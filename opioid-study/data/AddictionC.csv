2soonBoone|That's definitely when you start to become addicted. At least it is when you combine it with the utter despair from sober life being so relentlessly predictable. The question then is just how bad is addiction?
Modric-87|The problem with addiction is, that really good high where you are the master and feel like a God is long gone. Our mind cant forget those times, but everytime we get high its chasing that awesome high that will never come back again. At this point sober and high life both suck and then funtime is over.
Samuelbokay|Yes. Being high was great. Tolerance built up, money gone... . Eventually being broke and homeless and family-less and all fucked up going through withdrawal was hell
TravelPulse|I've been through this on the other side of it where I see someone indulging in substance abuse. While it may feel good for whomever is taking the drug, it can hurt the people that love you and care about you.
helpfulsj|Just wait until that feeling gets taken away and you cant stop using. This is the part everyone using is afraid to acknowledge. It seems like this cool underground lifestyle until you cant stop selling yourself for a hit or end up in prison. Any illusion of light will get taken away eventually as the drugs take over your life. Any illusion of control will fade away eventually, and you stop fighting and managing your life and the only thing that will take you out of your hell is an intervention from the law or death comes knocking and takes you away or scares you enough to stay clean.>It's a pathway that no one has certainty about.Everyone knows where this leads, it's only the person that is using that uncertain and thinks it might not end poorly. Caught in the delusion. What your describing is high, and the high goes away but the addiction doesn't. It soon becomes a matter of survival that goes before anything else in your life.
theyreinwa|That's true! It might make you feel young and powerful until you get sick and tired, then it just makes you feel normal.  When being sober sucks more than being high then you're addicted.
Deloit|Yes, you're absolutely right. People have to be ready to accept things. In this case, it's difficult to get consensus on basic facts, so I may be better off remaining in the background and not saying much. To your question, "How does your GF feel about the situation?" - Well, It's an interesting situation and actually answering that question gives you a little more context on why I spoke out to begin with. As I mentioned, this has been going on for 5 years and the brother actually almost died last year of an overdose. My girlfriend has a bit of an introverted personality and struggles with asserting herself - as such, when she does try to point out these same basic realities, she is promptly shut down by her parents. They will either just deny what she is saying is true, (such as buying a car is enablement or that they bought the car at all, get bogged down in what the definition of the word 'listen' is), or just label what she is saying as negativity and engage in diminishing her general worldview and attribute her "negativity" to her worldview. SO when she DOES speak out, her thoughts barely get through the web of defense mechanisms, and the debate about her brother's addiction will often be reversed into an indictment of her thoughts and attitudes towards life.This time around, I just couldn't take it anymore and was essentially just backing up my girlfriend. She thanked me afterward for helping her have a voice, but in doing so I guess I drew a huge line in the sand and have positioned myself as a threat to their attempts to make my girlfriend complicit in the enablement of the brother (if that makes sense).
Evilevilcow|You're not wrong. But from your GF's parents perspective, you're never going to be right by pointing out things that they aren't willing to accept.Addiction effects the whole family. And until the individuals are ready to each face it, they'll stay in denial. It's difficult, but unless someone asks you, I would try not to point out obvious logic errors.  If you do, expect that they may try to hide more things from you.How does your GF feel about the situation?
grandelusions|Here's the thing, you've been together for 10 years... a decade! If you can't even voice an opinion after 10 years of family dinners, then those people aren't worth helping. I'm salty because as a recovering addict I've been with my husband on and off for 14 years, exclusively for the last 8 and married for 5. His sister is an addict and his entire family is doing everything wrong to deal with this and has been for years. Over he last year the addict and I have gotten much closer for obvious reasons (I really want to help her stay clean and know she has true support even if it's just me and her brother) and my relationship with the rest of them is faltering because of it. I've been around this family long enough to realize that it doesn't matter what I say anymore, they are going to do whatever they are going to do. I've tried my damndest to stay quiet in the past and then some things happened last summer, I got thrown into the drama and I'm an open book with them now. It's to the point where they complain about her and I bring up specific recent and past behaviors or comments they have all done/made to perpetuate the problem(if you're not a part of the solution then....) Sometimes they listen, sometimes they get super pissed, either way... they are gonna hear it. I'm my husband's wife and their sister/daughter in law, they will hear me out or they will STFU about her. Whichever they choose, no skin off my back anymore. There comes a time where you have to get over making people mad when you're working for a greater purpose. You were totally correct in what you said and if they weren't being a part of the problem, they would see you were right and work to change it. The biggest success recovery stories IMO aren't the ones who overcame abuse and disease and homelessness. They're the ones that got/stayed clean while their "caring, loving, supportive" family members actively let them carry on with their addiction. These people are letting him be an addict, they don't love him, they love the idea of what he used to be.
princesslegolas|They're butthurt because your burst their bubble of denial. The fact they call it parenting advice also suggests just how much they're in an enablement and infantilisation process.... But.. They're your SOs parents and you gave then advice they didn't ask for... Be the bigger (saner) person, call them, apologise and continue as before. If they still cant cope then you know your conscience is totally clean and its all about their hurt. Unfortunately living with and loving addicts often means picking your battles and being the bigger person, but the gift of that is you get out of their drama circle.Good luck!
retired_junkiee|It’s a delicate topic. My parents thought they were complete failures. Btw I am in recovery for multiple years now and our lives are very different. I can’t imagine what it must feel like for them. There were times my folks cut me off and did the tough love thing but they also enabled me. Addiction is cunning and baffling. When I was using i was a different person. I am sorry you and your family are going through this but there is a solution out there if he is willing to change.
ClaireDraven|This is actually wonderful information to have.Also, Mental Illness Happy Hour is fantastic!!
GunnerMcGrath|I know you're interested in other things but you may benefit from going to nar anon. Family members of addicts tend to have more baggage than they realize and those groups can be very helpful.So sorry for your loss.
goodfrienddoc|Thank you, I didnt know there was nar anon, I'll have to go to one of the meetings.
tearsinrain66|SMART Recovery is great. It’s cognitive behavioural therapy based (science based). The meetings are a great place to develop a support group. Lots of meaningful discussion. And tools that work to help the individual manage the situation and work a recovery that keeps them clean and sober. Podcasts are also great. Dopey, mental illness happy hour, etc.
ExMethCokeHead|Hope the living situation gets better.Man, I’ve been in your shoes and what kept me going was the stuff and situations I knew I could only have while clean. Set up some sober goals or things to look forward to and then focus on those. Life sucks while tying to climb back up life sucks worst using n losing.
Flip123Flup|I don't know you but, I'm an (ex)addict?. It's been 7 years Ish. And i don't even know how to begin to say I'm sorry. The situation you are in sucks. It sounds like getting past this is important to you though so I'll say this.. do what you have to do. I think your right. If rehab is the best place for you to go to find that mental health, GO. 7 days at the shelter is shit but if that's what has to be to get there, do it. Depression is the biggest reason I used I can't sit here and tell you that shit will go away just cause you're clean. It's been 7 damn years and it's still a struggle. But at least now it's a struggle that's worth something. It does get better, never any easier but better. I swear.
ThisCatMightCheerYou|>I'm sad[Here's a picture/gif of a cat,](http://random.cat/i/1376593_717282458580_867040755_n (1).jpg) hopefully it'll cheer you up :).___ I am a bot. use !unsubscribetosadcat for me to ignore you.
allahusin8|If you need someone to talk to, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.Or if you're in a real ASAP crisis please use a suicide hotline. There's even text ones and app ones if you don't like talking on the phone.
dillpickledoritos|What seems like a setback for you now could become one of your greatest opportunities for improving your life. It sounds like you should do whatever it takes to get into residential treatment. I wish you the best.
lando421|thanks, i managed to get something figured out. Yesterday was a crisis, today I am moving forward. started a youtube channel as a place of confessions and to share my story. thats what i try to focus on, other than $$$ constantly :(
ClaireDraven|Have a couple questions, am PMing you, thank you.
Samuelbokay|#1 don't beat yourself up so hard. You are an addict; it's going to take some time to change that; it's going to take some time for your people to trust you again, but they knew you before you were an addict and they know that person still exists in there. Honesty is the best way- tell your people, parents, subs, SO, the truth. And continue to tell them the truth. Get to a 12-step meeting and don't let the goofy religious talk scare you off- don't let your addictive voice convince you that you don't want to hang out with us losers. Read "the Brain That Changes Itself' by Norman Doidge, about how we create neural pathways through addictions etc, and how to re-wire your brain. Get a sponsor, love yourself eventually. Good luck.
WonderfulAfternoon|I have'nt been strugling with amphetamines but I've got some pretty good insights to many other substances. I agree with luckycatsweaters about the thing that it would be easier to start with your bf. If he really cares, he'll really walk by your side. I also think it's best to start with the fact that you have a problem.The best way to start dealing with a problem is to break and analyze it in smaller parts. The problem seems almost everytime a lot harder when you look it as a one big pile of things that has to be done at once. Problemsolving in smaller portions is a lot easier, start with small and keep going.Honesty is really the best thing. Even though you have to accept the cruel fact that you loose the trust of your closest people . But trust can be gained back. Even though it might take a long time, but it will work for you as a motivational tool not to relapse. Personally I have noticed that people are dissapointed when told the truth, but on other hand they also respect other people who are honest and tell how things really are.Respect of others is the thing you really want in this life.And my opinion about rehab/medical detox is that they might help, but stopping amphetamines and recieving bentzos or some other sedatives for getting over your detox is not the best idea. These things are mental, not physical for the most part. You have to succeed yourself mentaly and you have to have a strategy with a goal to walk that road. Not saying that the physical part is'nt hard, it is. But if the detox is too easy, the change to relapse is bigger imo.When you go trough a really difficult detox, you know you do'nt want to do it again.  And to maintain your decision and when you are on your weakest point, you really could use someone to talk with. Stay strong,never give up.
eliminatethestigma|I agree with the replies here. First of all, you are not a bad person. Your addiction is making you make poor choices because that is how this thing works. The shame that comes from addiction is a huge factor that keeps us from getting help; thus, it is what kills us. It is extremely hard, and I have done it myself, but telling people you trust is a great first step. If they love you, they will help you.  The relief that you will feel when admitting your pain will be tremendous. For me, once I admitted my addiction, I was able to begin healing and getting back to the real me. In fact, I started a blog, [shamelessly sober ](www.shamelesslysober.com)  to share my journey. The honesty has been quite therapeutic. I found support from people I never knew had addictions too.Whatever method you feel you can use, share your struggle, at your own pace. Don’t beat yourself up. Millions of people have the same issues as you. Don’t compare yourself to others. You are not weak; you are simply sick and need help. Best wishes to you. You can do it!
jmm331|Hey man - I can totally relate to the way you feel.  You’re not alone. From my experience - when you tell people who love and care about you about your problem they just love and support you in getting better and are usually relieved because they probably already have some idea that something is up, but can come to grips with asking you. I would probably not address any of the stealing or anything just yet.  Just let them know where you are at and that you need help right now and you can make amends for things you’ve done further down the road once you get right. Good luck and Godspeed. It gets better.
luckycatsweaters|I’m so sorry that you are struggling :( addiction is the single most difficult thing I have had to overcome in life, and I have nothing but heartbroken sympathy for those who are still sick and suffering.  The shitty thing about it all is that it’s *who we are* that drives us to use drugs (and situations, things, people, anything that crosses our path of self destruction), and to recover requires a complete overhaul of us as a person. I think I mentioned it in another post to the same OP, but the bittersweet thing about rock bottom is that it is a solid foundation on which you can rebuild yourself to become whoever it is you truly desire to be. You don’t have to be a prisoner of loneliness caused by your addiction, there is a better life out there waiting for you to step into it. PM me if you want to talk about it. Life is a bear and we aren’t made to handle it alone (as much as our addiction does it’s best to convince us that nobody understands us and we don’t deserve the love of those who do). It can only get better from here, friend :)
streetspirit81|Urge you to get to an NA meeting. Being with fellow addicts as well as working the 12 Sreps will help you take it day by day in battling your addiction. I'm 8 months in and would go aa far as saving it saved my life. That is providing I keep in touch with the program itself.It's brave of you to share this with us - wishing you the best of luck in your recovery
4research156|Hey, man, I just wanted to say good job. As a current addict, it's so inspiring to read these-- especially when it's in the first stages of recovery like yours. I'm so glad you survived that sucidal urge. When it hits, it hits hard its and it's almost impossible to shake off. It's something you need to ride through. From everything you've said, you've displayed so much strength. I have no doubt that you can pull through. Like you said, it's going to be rough but worth it! We're pulling for you! L x
Modric-87|Haha me too.
deanobagio|I miss you and love you sunflower.
evil_leaper|*Reads this as* "Loving this new Eminem/Russell  Brand collabo!"*Comes back from Google disappointed.*
HoneyBunch1017|Thank you, and please, take care of yourself, as well.
YeahNoYeahMaybe|So sorry for your loss. :(
swingsandwhatnot|Yes that is sad and such a shame. It is heart breaking. We should all be kinder and help other as much as we can.
ClaireDraven|Depends on what you're coming off of and how severe your withdrawal symptoms are, but in general, the rules of thumb here are: 1) Keep yourself occupied, and 2) Be around people (the sober ones, obviously), whether you want to or not. Socialization will keep your mind occupied, and human connection is essential. If you're into the god thing, then the previous commenter's suggestion, NA/AA is totally your best bet. They recommend 90 in 90: 90 meetings in 90 days. Find a sponsor and commit to it.Good luck!
SOmuch2learn|Get professional help and go to support group meetings.
clockworkbuddha|As above - there’s little per se that will make it less painful and so easier, but plenty you can do to help you bear that pain and get through it - mainly getting support and being able to tell people how you feel and letting them help you. To feel vulnerable and in need of help can feel very alien and wrong to dependents - fight that feeling and reach out
witherspleen|Hit a AA/NA meeting. It will be enlightening to be in a room full of people of all ages and walks of life with the same problem talk about their crazy histories and how they are succeeding, struggling, or just living. Some groups are tiny, some are huge. I tried a few first couple of attempts, didn’t stick for me, and to be fair, it doesn’t work for everyone. But when I got desperate for anything that would work I went back and I’m 5y clean and sober now.
GodsGeneral|Do you have insurance? With a benzo habit of that long you really want medically-assisted detox. And it will make your life infinitely more bearable for the opiate withdrawal (with clonidine, phenobarb, etc.). Your restless legs is gonna get a lot worse and your surgeries are gonna ache beyond hell. I would seek treatment. 7-10 day MAD at minimum. Followed by inpatient if feasible with insurance / employment. At least outpatient counseling and support.Life does get better. It just gets worse first. Good luck.
Katsie463|Witherspleen,Beautifully said. So nice to talk to a fellow theatre kid here. Thank you for taking the time to respond. I think the thing that will help me the most is being with my family every minute of everyday cheering me on and taking care of me when I feel the worst. They are worried about my safety but I've assured them that I will be going through withdrawals but it's nothing we can't deal with. They just want to make sure I am safe. I know that tapering is a safe way to go. I think cold turkey would be another story. I want to reassure my family that this detox is not something I can die from. My husband is not a drug user of any sort. Not even ibuprofen so he's nervous that I won't be safe. But, I think I will be safe but just super uncomfortable. My question is, tapering is a safe way right? And I know you can't die from withdrawals unless is benzos or alcohol. I just want to reassure me family. I felt confident until they got so worried and I have diagnosed OCD so now I'm worrying too. (Even though I've been through withdrawals before)
Newmommy31|I know what it's like to feel in bondage to something I'm a recovering heroin addict I went from heroin to methadone to suboxone. Its been very hard heroine withdrawal is something terrible and unexplainable but even though I'm kinda against methadone clinics because in Alabama you can't get a script you have to go to a clinic but I know a lot of people that say methadone works better for their pain than anything else. But the xanax is just dangerous I hope you get some relief
cvanagas|Hey, so first of all, I totally feel you. Life sucks being in pain, and life sucks on meds. At least, when you’re off, though, the “suck” is stable, and not constantly peaking/dropping. I have chronic daily headaches and severe TMJ. I’m in constant pain, and have been for 12 years. I started on Vicodin, getting it prescribed. They moved me to oxy’s (15mg taken once daily). Every month, I’d go to my doc and say it’s not enough.. how I couldn’t function, and was suicidal. He didn’t budge tho. I did this for years, until I finally broke, and bought heroin. I never used needles, only smoked it. And it was easy to justify, as I was taking it medicinally, not recreationally. Like you though, I ended up blowing every cent I have, and ruining my life over it. Even though I was taking them for pain, not recreationally, I still decided to put myself into treatment. I went on methodone about a year ago (I wasn’t healthy enough to do a full detox at the time). Even though I’m not a traditional addict, I still benefitted a great deal from going into treatment. The accountability (UA’s) helped me, and the reward system (if you do well, you come in less) helped as well. Also, I went to like 3-4 groups a week when I first started (wasn’t working as much) and they helped SO much. I always walked out feeling totally cleansed, like I just came out of church or something. It gave me a place to talk about my suffering, where people really cared and wanted to help. I also got to help others, which was so great for me, emotionally. So yeah, couple factors here at play. The groups are very important. Having someone to hold you accountable, so you’re not cheating, is also very important (where you can’t lie your way out of it). Having rewards in place, for doing well, is also a great idea. If I were you, I would taper, and then go on suboxone. It’s important you’re not doing this yourself... outpatient rehab at a minimum. And everyone always bashes rehab, but me personally, I loved it. I made so many great friends, and had SO many awesome people that supported me. I also learned a lot. The benzos can be super dangerous... definitely talk to your doctor about that. Also, I would NOT recommend getting off benzos, AND opiates at the same time. I’d quit the opiates first. When you quit, make sure you have someone to take care of you, who can check in on you frequently. I don’t know how far down you can taper, and how bad the w/d’s would be with ample suboxone, but you’re gonna want to be treated like you had the flu. Soup/ritz crackers. Someone to change the sheets if you get too sweaty. Massages help. Someone to make electrolyte water etc... also, sleeping pills are a must. There’s a lot more here to say, but I don’t want to give too much info. I’m about the same age as you, and I also have really bad chronic pain, so if you want to talk more, please feel free to message me. I’d even welcome a phone call as well. I’ve been thru it, lol.Take care and good luck =]
pillhead123|Suboxone over a few months was great for me, but I was in the mind set to do it.  I tried a self taper, and it was hell.  By day 3 I felt inhuman.  Off to the doctor, the hardest part was admitting that I needed help.  Once that was done, the suboxone started, and I was dubious.  I've read that people get hooked on suboxone rather than what they were taking, and never make it off of that.  I also heard that people said it was harder to quit suboxone than it was to quit what got them there in the first place.ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE, at least not for me.The doctor started what I thought was a REALLY strong dose of Suboxone ... I think it was stronger than what I was taking, honestly, I was so high it was making me nervous, but I found out that they need to fill up all of your Opiod receptors at first since Suboxone is only a partial opiod agaonist.  From here, they stabilize your dosage over a few days and then taper gradually.I went from 8mg to 4 mg to 2 mg to .5 mg over about 6 months.  Each time things were tapered I was nervous that I'd have jitters, DT's or cravings but other than a caffeine like anxiety and maybe a headache or two in the mornings, I was normal at each taper.  The reason for this is the long acting nature of Suboxone / Bupenophrene.  This worked so well and I was able to maintain a normal work and social life without being sweaty, jittery, or anything.  If you are having a hard time I recommend doing this with your doctor.  Stay on regimen!  Don't deviate, don't slip up, and do not take more than you are prescribed, Suboxone is much stronger than oxycodone, and taking more than you should will only lengthen your taper.  If you take longer than some people, the doctor should also stretch your taper treatment out as well.  Let me know if you have any questions, I'd be happy to help.
savagehenrysLSD|I broke my back when I was 18. I was prescribed Norco, but my friends and I were illegally buying Oxycontin when Purdue Pharma was making it. I told my pain management specialist that I needed something more concentrated. He moved me to oxycontin. Within a few months I got my prescription bumped up to 150 oc 80mg a month, and a few100mic fentanyl patches that lasted three days also. I became a full blown addict for 8 years. My story is an odd one. But, I decided to get clean, for me. I tried methadone, but ended up abusing that also. So I just stopped taking everything. I was smoking alot of weed but it wasn't enough. That sickness is BRUTAL. After a many painful days I couldn't take it anymore. I hated myself.  I was on my couch with a 9mm in my lap. Then I remembered something. My friend left psychedelic mushroom chocolates in my freezer. I had never tried psychedelics, so I put my gun away and ate them. Changed everything. Took away many withdrawal symptoms. I jumped up and took my dog to the meadows and forest near by. Sat out there for hours, and realized I would get better every day, day by day. I forgave myself. I have some really good friends that took me in and helped me a few hours away. I learned new skills and trades. Long story short. Mushrooms and LSD are awesome for withdrawal, in proper doses that vary from person to person. They are not addictive. If you want to wean down, have a trusted friend or family member keep your meds locked away. Make a goal and a regiment dropping dosage. Eat well. Drink a ton of water. You are right, Kratom is awesome, but you can't use it daily
witherspleen|Katsie, you e for a bit of a road ahead of you. Some sort of pain management and withdrawal assistance will be helpful. So something low impact like cannabis and extracts might be very helpful, and a doctor could help with if it’s something that works for you.I’ve been clean of everything for five years now, but it was the uppers for me, not the downers. The opiates are notorious for their physical withdrawal, and I salute you for your commitment/intention. One thing that helped me a great deal was peer support groups. Yes, like NA/AA. Ignore anyone who tries to tell you it’s about religion, it’s not, it’s about opening to the possibility of something greater than ourselves. We each form our own belief system. When I got to my bottom, I realized that screw it, I’d try anything to stop, and doing that was about the only thing I had left to try. They do preach complete abstinence, but I found being in a room full of people who share their experience, eerily similar to mine, very helpful. It can’t hurt, in any case, and will get you focusing on something and out of the house (maybe with someone you trust to stay safe)Tapering smoothly is probably the best, but your brain will start making you a bit desperate for the next dose. Keep it occupied, meditate, pray, do what you gotta do. In the end you’re not resisting the urge of something you want, you’re fighting against something you want no part of. I wish you the very best. Also a theatre kid here.
amolavitaa|I agree. Being physically dependent and being addicted are two different things treated differently and handled differently and that’s important to know.
brainwash_|There's no need to argue semantics when OP is clearly trying to get off a medication. This might not be the best sub for them but maybe we could help them out instead of shitting on them for mixing up withdrawal and addiction?
clockworkbuddha|I’m not shitting on them - the treatment would be different, and the question is - is it a problem if it’s keeping them well?This is stuff a Dr would ask...
ethly|if you want get off olanzapine, you should taper off it. Just tell the doctor, they can't force you to take something you don't want.
heyitsmely|Probably yes, my body asks me for the medicine and if I don’t get it I feel really bad.When I get it I feel fine
OGpizza|Yes and no. On one hand, this person was most likely drinking more and more often than they told you, otherwise putting down 18 drinks in 4 hours should leave even a heavyweight pretty impaired. However, the thing about addict behavior is that once their brain has had a taste of such a high level of inebriation, even when the tolerance goes down, they will recognize that there IS a higher level they can reach...basically someone who knows that “at my peak, I could put down 18 beers in 4 hours” will resort to drinking 18 beers in 4 hours when they choose to binge—they can’t accept settling for less than what they know is possible. But, if a tolerance has built up, they will definitely be waaaay more messed up at this point than they used to be. But, being as messed up as possible was always their goal, so it’s a win-win, lose-lose scenario.
SOmuch2learn|This person is an alcoholic.
Ho_Kogan|Damn dude, sorry to hear that you are in this state.I'm in bed, coming out of a depressive state for the past 2 months and I empathize.Get well soon
Samuelbokay|"Mom, dad, I need your help advice and support. I'm addicted to drugs and I don't want to be anymore. I'm an addict so I might be a lying asshole during the process of getting clean, I might relapse but I need your help."  And go see an addictions counsellor too and find an NA group (or AA works too) in your area.   Lots of times our addictive voice will try to convince us "I'm not so bad, just a few more hits..." But the downward spiral is fast and easy. If you recognize a problem when you are young do your life and your future a big favour and gain control now. I'm over 50 and fucked up relationships, family and jobs through addictive behaviours. Good luck making your smart honest choices.
The_Sloth_Racer|Can you tell me more about your situation? How old are you? Are you in school? What drugs do you use? How frequently? For how long? How are they impacting your life?
andrewguerrero1993|I’m 24 I’ve been a On and off user of cocaine for 3 years I can go on binges and isolate myself from friends and family it has taken a toll on my emotions and my financial situation.  It started as a party thing and I thought nothing of it from party’s it became a every weekend thing to a being high at work and having to lie about when I used to people who knew I had a problem. I admitted to myself I was an addict and went public with it to friends. I recently relapsed and i don’t know what’s wrong with me I was clean for months and just my overwhelming sadness took over and I caved to the drugs.
d_t_s1997|Yes go and tell them about your addiction problems before it get any more worst. I was addicted to ketamine 2 years ago and the only people help me get out of it was my mom and dad. So go for it bro, hope you get out soon, good luck !!!!
jason544770|It actually feels like you're taking care if things when you actually tell them. It's kind of empowering..As far as how i would just sit them down and tell them. I would tell them not to worry and that you have a plan
Greeneyedgirl17|I agree with every other wonderfully encouraging thing said above. The one good thing about addiction, is that it doesn’t discriminate. Rich poor man women black white or any color in-between. It just gets people who are trying to escape. This is most likely a symptom of a much larger problem. Food has become a maladaptive coping mechanism for you. You might be dealing with anxiety or depression etc and to deal with Those distressing ideas you have developed  an obsession with food that plagues you with persistent and intrusive thoughts about it. These obsessions escalate to compulsions in which to relieve your negative mood you binge. It provides immediate relief and this isn’t just mental, your body will react in the same way. So your brain has learned that feeling bad=food=binge=temporary relief. So it’s not crazy that this compulsion keeps occurring, your brain is actually being quite rational. But these are maladaptive coping mechanisms and will just compound your emotional state in the future- leading to more binging. It’s kind of a self fulfilling prophecy. You have to give your brain a chance to see what happens if you don’t binge. Do you die? Do you feel worse? Do you feel like better? Because right now all it knows is binging is the go to problem solver for stress etc. I can not recommend exercise enough for this. The studies of its effect on humans makes it out to be he closest thing to magic. It basically helps with everything. So next time you have the urge to binge, try taking a walk. Removing your self from the situation, get away from temptation. If your new to exercise, that’s fine! I’m not saying run a half marathon, but I bet thirty mins a day would make you feel a lot better. You also have to identify the feelings that drive you to binge, so seriously try and talk to a counselor!  Also medication could help you with impulse control and cut down on intrusive thoughts. This is a common problem and is by no means chronic! It’s better to address it early than to let it escalate into further pathology. Good luck!

None|Don't undermine your problem! It's called addiction and it works the same way for all of us regardless of what it is you are addicted to. Drugs, food, porn, sex or video games. The brain can't tell the difference.Nice work admitting your problem. As i was reading your post i felt really moved, you used the same words and feelings when describing your situation as anyone with any other addiction goes through. Hence we are all the same.I'm an addict as well. When i stopped doing drugs, the addict inside me kept feeding itself with all sorts of thing. Sometimes sex, others food or TV series. I have to keep the addict inside under control as it will allways keep looking for ways to break free.
SebbyHafen|My man! Of course you're welcome here! :) we're all in this together with different things of our own going on.I'm so glad you were able to come talk a little more about it. Keep us all updated on how you're doing and PM me if you ever want to chat or if there's ever anything I can help you with
SlickitySlothh|Don’t ever question your worthiness here my friend, we’re all equals, no matter what we’re addicted to. Food isn’t a problem for me so I can’t think of any advice besides things you’d find with a google search, If drugs were your problem, I’d be able to help way more. I do hope you find useful info, and if you don’t feel up to doing it yourself, message me and I’ll gladly do the research for you, and give you the links. Hope to hear updates. Good luck friend, and welcome.
amolavitaa|As a recovering pill addict, it was weird to me that I didn’t have a bad childhood or have anything crazy drastic happen to me and I still question WHY I’m wired that way. But try not to focus on that. I try to just think of every hour and I talk about it w my boyfriend a lot. I read a lot about addiction as well. A lot of people have gone what you are going through! You can do this. We all have our struggles. Be honest with yourself, that was the hardest thing for me.
bouncyphoenix|Just stopping by to say- I relate, and you are not alone. I don't have any advice but I am here with you.
farmerdog69|Talk to a counselor about it if you haven't already. There could be other things going on in your life.If you have very recently left home to go to university, it can be a disorienting time. Anyway , can relate. Addiction is addiction. Try replacing it with a less severe addictive activity. Exercise is a good one.
AddictionProblem|For me it would be enough to cut ties with the person I were living with if that person were doing such a hard drug and getting "angry" when the person involved wants to protect their assets. Maybe he understand how drugs like that alters your brain and messes you up in the long run. If you really care about him you should seek help, meth is not a soft drug, it will make you live on the street.
MarlaBullets|I really think he's trying. He's going to help me get into therapy. I think he's just afraid and wants to take harsher actions than I was expecting..
RotaryFlare12|He should definitely be more empathetic and try to see things from your point of view and support you no matter what.
DylvdB|I think that that is the right mindset. Because essentially it is just loss. The moment you deposit money in a account, it is basically lost..
I-AM-NOT-FOOD|I think realising you have a problem at such a young age gives you a big advantage. My grandmother, aunts and uncles all have gambling addictions they haven't managed to shake.My dad was apparently bad but got help before he married my mum (funnily enough, at age 23).My brother was a fiend from 18 - he stole thousands of dollars from me and countless others... but by 30 he'd beaten it and now he's almost 10 years free.More importantly, I've long since forgiven him. Everyone who loves him has. Use that as fuel to help you keep going.
farkalark|keep reminding yourself you're just going to lose every time you play, turn off that pleasure effect and replace it with the sense of loss.  ex smokers hate smokers, ex alcoholics have a disdain for alocoholics....you gotta do the same, i lost 30k in 3 months, online, still trying to pay it off....5 years later.... :(
amolavitaa|Ah I understand. It’s def a tough situation. I’ve been on the other end and it kills me every day the shit I put my family and boyfriend through. For real. Even tho I’ve been clean 7 months (which isn’t that long I know that) I still feel so much guilt. I hope you find peace and a solution. If you need anything or even anyone to talk to feel free to message me!
turtlemachines|My siblings and I have all agreed an involuntary hold would not be the correct course of action. I've sat and talked many times throughout the years both calmly and kindly as well as wildly upset. Unfortunately its the same "i promise ill never do this again" and then it repeats. Thank you for the advice though its greatly appreciated!!
BORKBORKPUPPER|Same here. It was several months... I'd feel great one day and the next day having all kinds of symptoms. I even felt out of my own body at times. 2 years later my life is much better and I'm so glad I didn't cave all those times I really wanted to. You got this!
Blubarries|It wouldn’t hurt to seek medical opinions to make your detox more safe and give you peace of mind.
RuffSamurai|Just for future reference. Or hopefully not future reference. You basically waste Ativan by snorting it.
Samuelbokay|I agree with above comments. With your mix it'll take a while to detoxify. Good luck. You can do it!
ayydance|He's probably still alive because of the shit BOA from insuffulation
rowtahd|I had some chest pains for years. I told my doctor about it, she said "meh, it's just anxiety."Kept having the pains and went back to her. My cholesterol was fine and my EKG was perfectly normal. After that I started to believe her that it was just anxiety and haven't felt a thing since. I'm a few years younger than you are.
underground_crane|When I went through benzo withdrawal my symptoms were coming and going for months.
voluntold123|Thanks Bork, I appreciate that. I’m trying to stay strong.
4research156|Thank you! For all of this! Honestly, I didn't know how to describe it but you put it perfectly. I am addicted to the feeling of being high, however I can get it. This is the only place I won't lie so I won't say "Yes! I'll get therapy no problem!" But I will consider and hopefully gather the courage to tell someone about this so I can get help. Thank you so much, you've helped me more than you know. I hope you get better.
frostmechanic1|Any time! and same to you. It'll be hard but you've got this. The first step to solving anything is asking the right questions. I plan on trying NA today.
Modric-87|Appreciate this, thank you!
mrtrav50|Thank you for checking it out. And i am happy you found some value in it ☺
A_Trusted_Fart|Real fucking mature. This person came asking for help and you're just going to do some shit like that? Why are you on this sub anyways? Just to troll people? If you don't have advice to give, don't say anything at all. Anyways, this place obviously isn't going to give you the answers you need. Your best bet is to do some research online and see what programs and steps are out there for this specific addiction. While most programs help a wide variety of addictions, I'm not too familiar with masturbation addiction to give you a 100% answer. Just do some looking online, try to find support groups in your area. Tag along with your friend if they don't feel comfortable going by themselves or find out what other programs and steps have worked for others and go from there. I wish you and your friend the best of luck.
Digitalpaver|How?
Modric-87|SLAA meetings! Its for sex addicts.  Also the books from Patrick Carnes are awesome! Hope this helps a little bit.
None|[deleted]
Pm_MeyourManBoobs|If you can give him a hand I'm sure he'll really appreciate it
Samuelbokay|Addiction to masturbation, or porn and masturbation. See the good folks at R/nofap   They have some interesting approaches and Frank if somewhat excited discussions about porn and masturbation.  Also check the SAA website for the addiction self-test. Requires a little personal honesty, but it may get the reader thinking "ami? No, no way... Ok maybe that one a little." Ultimately, the decision to define my problem is up to me, since anyone else telling me I have a problem before I'm ready to admit it will be met with denial. (Not just a river in Egypt)
voltagenic|Or any other orifice for that matter.  I don't see why this would be seen as a negative response.  Masturbation is normal and shouldn't be looked at as a bad thing or an addiction.  Sure, some folks can get compulsive with it, but rectifying that usually requires finding a partner or similar.
ABurlyKeel|When I was deepest in my addiction (not cigarettes), I went on a 10-day retreat. Getting through that 10-day retreat at least planted the seed in my mind that I could actually beat my addiction. If nothing else, it is worth a shot. I really did have to take the retreat one day or even one hour at a time. It was tough, but you can get through it if you really want to.
Jzurb|Go to a counsellor. 12 Step isn't treatment, it's support. And it can work for some people but it doesn't work for all. A counsellor will help you get to the root of the problem and work through that while also proving you with coping skills. And if you feel 12 step helps, you can use that at the same time.
MadManCharlies4449|I have a twelve step group that meets 6 nights a week. I started attending last week but broke off into a relape that I’m currently in the midst of. I broke last Monday. Admitted my relapse to the group on Thursday. For this weekend I’ve been actively setting out to destroy myself.I’ve taken probably 110 pills and 8oz of syrup. In addition to this I’ve drank a liter of mouthwash. Desperate alcoholism is gross.You I appreciate you taking the time to write all this out. I won’t take any of advice for granted. I am gonna get sober again. And this time I’ll stay sober.
Modric-87|Best advice from me, once you get out of the nightmare and think life is boring in recovery. Dont pick up the first one or something "softer", it kicked me right back into hell and I dont know how to get out of it anymore, I feel so fucking stupid that I have ruined it.
Sidvicious843|This is serious stuff, an hour a day is nothing in return for a chance at life.
underground_crane|I was dishonourably discharged from the Navy for drugs when I was 25. They tried to help me, they sent me to rehab, but I wasn’t ready to be clean. It broke my heart, it was my dream job.
junehs|My advice is going to be seen as pure hell for you. Quitting my caffeine/soda (mainly Dr. Pepper) addiction was one of the worst, but most rewarding experiences I had. I stopped because I am trying to lose weight and be healthier overall and soda was a big culprit for me. When I had stopped, I went cold turkey. It was the worst thing I had ever endured. Headaches, agitation, and restlessness. But it does get better after a week. If you can survive the first week of going cold turkey, then it really does wonders to you and your overall health. Food actually tasted different in my case and I had more energy than what soda had originally given me.If cold turkey is a no go, my brother had cut soda out of his diet by dropping it to like 1 can a day (he had 3 or 4), to slowly 2 a week, once a week, so forth. It eventually is weaned out your system. I wish you luck! Soda addiction is the worst.
noobpsych|I used to have a can-a-day Red Bull habit that I would sip through the afternoon. Then while getting several cavities filled, the dentist mentioned my enamel wasn't looking too good. He asked if I drank a lot of soda, and I said no, as I don't drink cokes regularly. Then I mentioned the Red Bull, saying I only had one a day in the afternoons. He told me that slowly sipping like that was basically bathing my teeth in sugar for half a day. If I had to, I should drink it without too much delay and brush my teeth afterward. So I guess in the name of harm reduction: if you gotta have your daily Monster, don't stretch it out all day.
Modric-87|Get away with it? Thats your addiction speaking mate. You dont get away with shit, its just that you dont care at that moment what happens too you.
SOmuch2learn|NEVER.
hotcorndoggy|Hey. I’m sorry you’re feeling this way. My only advice is to think about your future. Like where do you want to be when you’re 55.. how about 80? You have a lot of life ahead of you, make it a good one!!
GunnerMcGrath|Yes, it's a learned coping mechanism. It's not just drugs, but any addictive behavior. The thing to realize is that you don't want the drug, you want the numbing or whatever escape it provides. If you work through your issues and learn healthier ways of coping with your discomfort the addiction loses a lot of power.
KolyaIvanov|Heroin is mine and it seems to forever be there lurking in my mind waiting whispering
MarlaBullets|Thanks man, you too.
Modric-87|I think the same.
PurpleSweetz|Completely agree. My first love was adderall. Down the line I fell to my knees and became powerless over IV heroin; but while clean, the desire to do adderall is stronger than the one to do heroin. And that was years ago, while I only have 31 days clean of heroin today.
SOmuch2learn|It doesn't ever "go away" but addiction goes into remission with treatment and ongoing support. Having a therapist and working the 12 steps gave me tools to build a sober, happy life.
Savvy_Bean|I disagree to a certain extent, for me personally I will never even allow lsd around my proximity again since a traumatizing experience got me to quit cold turkey. I'm disgusted by it in every sense of the word. I'm decidedly over it.  Marijuana on the other hand, even after being sober from it I still somewhat crave it subliminally.
Werotus|I agree.I don't think addiction ever truly goes away. That's  why the only way to stay clean is to stay completely away from from the drug you have a problem with.
abolishreligion|It’s kind of like getting shot. You can be rushed to the hospital, have the bullet removed, get stitched up and sent home with a comprehensive plan on how to heal from your injury. One day you will be fully recovered from the gunshot wound. This by no means makes you bulletproof from here on out.
ayydance|If you're here on this board and acknowledge your addiction, you're already on the path to quitting. There will come a point where the pain of continuing is greater than the pain of stopping. You can do it man, the addiction is just telling you what you need to hear to justify using.
beeblejuice37|I completely see where you’re coming from. All of the other times I’ve relapsed I’ve tricked myself Into believing that I can handle my addiction and I can just do it sometimes. That I’m not really an addict and I’m different than everyone else and I can “smoke crack and do heroin just on weekends”. Sometimes I can’t understand how stupid your brain can be. But yes. That’s why I like to tell myself that it will never be too easy. And one moment of weakness is not just one moment but your entire life. I relate to what you said so much
ezmakesbad|Oh man is that statement ever true with being a gamblining addict at one point. I know better not to go but maaaaaaybe one more time won't hurt... Ya ok brain, good one.
godofsadness1996|I wish you the best on your road to recovery I’ve tried to stop in the past and always failed I’ve cut down but I fear I’ll be trapped forever in the cycle.
gratefulforit|I've been clean from all mood and mind altering substances for multiple decades.  I actively work a program of recovery, attend meetings, work with sponsor/sponsees.  I've not had a craving in a long time, but that being said, the thought still occasionally crosses my mind.   This is why I continue to "stay close".  I know my disease is there, and patient.
ishaimmic|I agree speed is mine
justanotheraddict81|Once an addict always an addict. But I take solace in the knowledge that I may be powerless over my addiction but it is my choice but to use!
musical_froot_loop|It seems to me that the best way to fight it is by developing something else in your life that you can put your energy into. Not that that makes it go away, but it seems like it helps.
ofir2006|I'd have to disagree, after 10 years of smoking I am today crave free, it wasn't easy though.Benzos was a real bitch too, but they're forming dependency rather than addiction, there is difference, once I sorted out the reason I took benzos, I no longer needed them.
shootz-n-ladrz|I don’t think that it’s impossible for me to relapse again you know? I relapsed A LOT when I first was trying to get clean. I don’t think I had hit my bottom until I hit it finally and there was no where to go. I was also super lucky that my parents were there for me and helped me when I was ready to get clean. At this point, I have SO much to lose, I have a career, husband, house and a child. If there’s a perfect storm of shit I think it’s possible for anyone to relapse. If I do think about it, cause it does come up now and again, I remember everything I have to lose and the high isn’t enough for me to lose it.When I got clean I found something I really wanted to do and made it the most important thing to me. I worked my ass off and every time I had a craving or felt like I wanted to give up and use again I remembered my goal and how much I wanted that. I remembered all of the people in my life who believed I wouldn’t make it and I would be nothing but a “heroin whore” for the rest of my life and I would get angry and remember that I was worth it and my goal was worth it to not give up. I wanted to prove those people wrong so badly and I wanted to prove to myself that I could do this. It’s wasn’t easy and there are sometimes even nearly a decade later that I get frustrated because in my profession I have to disclose my past addiction sometimes and I nearly didn’t make it because of it. (I had to pass a “character” test and my past addiction was basically thrown in my face and I had to prove that I am a different person now than I was then. I got that anger again and used it to fight with everything I had to make my goal happen.)Sometimes, in the beginning, it really was like the programs say, 24 hours at a time, an hour at a time, ten minutes at a time you know? If it was bad, I would distract myself and wait it out, remember that it will pass, eventually it will pass and I will still be clean. Every time that I could wait it out it made it easier the next time. I didn’t really go to meetings or anything because for me they were a part of the old people I used to hang with and shit. I had a personal therapist I would see once or twice a week that I loved and comfortable with. She helped me through everything and work through a lot of issues I had.This got super long I’m sorry. I don’t know if it helps at all but idk I think you need something to believe in and something to achieve and then you’ll start to believe in yourself that you can do it and you can stay clean. I’m sorry, I ramble.
swingsandwhatnot|This is what scares me that it's something I'm going to have to deal with everyday.
tearsinrain66|That’s why you have to work your recovery for the rest of your life.
underscore_frosty|I think you hit the nail on the head. As my dad was telling me when I was in detox/inpatient psychiatric care, once you become a pickle you can never go back to being a cucumber.
vladthedracul|Yeah, it never goes away the constant struggle between "let's go get my fix" and "no". But as time passes the voice in your head that tells you to get your fix gets smaller and duller.
whatisthisabout123|Actually dude it gets so easy that you completely believe you can control stuff. I was 7 years sober, former heroin addict. I actually drank like a gentleman for 2 years and now things are starting to fall apart and I have to stop. What happens is that you actually can handle it if you’ve gotten yourself healthy for years. Then you start having a bad few months and that beer you had at lunch now sounds good when you are lonely and angry at home. Then you start using it as an escape instead of something that enhances your life. Then other things sound good and pretty soon you are content with self destruction. My point is it gets super easy, too easy in fact.
yellowmush|Addiction is forever. No matter how much clean time we have, we will always be addicts. We have to work a recovery program for the rest of our life and make that program the most important part of our life.The moment we start to believe we don’t have a problem any longer is a dangerous road to go down.
Deep_Thotz|Do you have a therapist? Seeing someone on a weekly basis can help you work through your addictions
HariTerra|You are right. I deleted my post.
NiczymPuma|I was actually planning on eating shrooms like Amanita Muscaria as they aren't really close to LSD or DMT, only gives you buzz similar to alcohol. Some of my friends already did acid, and some are planning on taking it first time with me soon (like in next 6 months).However I really don't see a deeper sense in doing psychodelics. As for me it is type of a drug I really would like doing only once or two, I used to play video games a lot and I came to realisation that I have to stop escaping into other worlds, I just like our world as it is, without superpowers and unicorns :)I had a talk with my friend not so long ago where I explained to him that as for me being on acid is just like putting VR gogles onHowever I never did anything like this (neither acid or vr gogles) so take this comment with huge dose of ..... (I don't really know an english word for it but I assume you know what I mean)
None|[deleted]
PurpleSweetz|Addiction is a disease of *more* - it goes far deeper than drugs, let alone any one type of drug. For me, anything that gives me pleasure, my mind wants me to keep doing it in excess until I hate it or I end up causing destruction in my life.
helpfulsj|Thanks for understanding where I am coming from. I think that when done properly and in a safe setting the majority of the time psychedelics can be beneficial, for healthy individuals. It can be risky when you are battling mental illness. The right setting is pretty hard to achieve for "healing" purposes. For example, most people do not know real shamans and have the ability/time to really be with a tribe of people that understand how to guide someone on a psychedelic experience. the majority of people will just cop a few doses of DMT and when its over they will still have the same using buddies, the same pressures to keep using drugs, the same consequences from there using that keeps them coming back, the same mental illness possibly causing the substance abuse disorder. They will still have the same hijacked dopamine and neurotransmitter systems.There is a lot that goes into getting out of addiction and the mental aspect is just one part of it. There has to be basically a whole lifestyle and environment change to take place for the majority of people. For some people psychedelics launch that individual on the right path, for others it takes them down a very dissociative road where they become disconnected from themselves and reality. Do some more research on prolonged DMT use and look for the bad experiences.
mrtrav50|Strike when the coals are hot.. If you can go to treatment, id say do it. Its not a perfect solution but can give some structure with no using.. The voice that says im not ready will not just go away. To make it happen needed a leap of faith through the fear. Thats my experience anyway, havent had to use in a little over 9 years. Best of luck my friend!
Disasteroflife|Thank you for this. My parents spent about $18k on my last rehab trip back in October/November. I am on private insurance through their work. I was supposed to be taken off the insurance at the end of March because it's too expensive for them. I'm pretty sure I'm going to fess up to my counselor in the morning, who will in turn contact my probation officer, so I'm thinking I might see jail time. At this point, I just can't fight it anymore. I just need to be honest and say I'm not in control and take the consequences. I just feel so terrible for putting then through this. They are in their mid/late 60's and I'm putting them through hell. My dad has had two heart attacks in the last 4 years. I just get extremely down and depressed and it seems like nothing is real and I just do what my brain tells me to to survive. I'm not trying to make excuses, I could have tried to reach out. It is like auto pilot takes control and I can't think past it to the bigger picture. I've just been locked downstairs in my room since my father called me. I have no excuses for what I've done. I was so depressed the night before last that I was hurting physically. I'm going to call my counselor in the morning and just do whatever is advised, and tell him me being here is too dangerous, so whatever I need to do to get myself away from my family so I don't hurt them anymore I will do. I am terrified. But this just keeps going in circles and I keep fucking up. Sorry for the rant, I really appreciate you taking the time to reach out. I hope I am salvageable. And if not, I hope I get put somewhere where I won't do so much harm to those I love.
Modric-87|Just wanna say my story is almost similar man! You are not alone in your room, I aint leaving mine either. Im just to scared to reach out for help AGAIN and fail AGAIN. Im so done with this and all the people around me are done with my "so called" addiction problems, like anyone gives a shit.
musical_froot_loop|I hear you and I see your struggle. As you go through this process, be on the lookout for people who are kind; people who are wise; people who have something to teach you. Going to jail by itself has pros and cons. I appreciate that you want to take responsibility for your actions. But if you do end up doing time, find the people and activities and ideas that can help you become a better person. I do wish you well. My heart breaks for you as it does for my son.
only1interest|Is it possible to go back to rehab?  Four months shows you can live clean, people relapse, it can take more than one try.  Stopping what you are doing and staying clean is the only way you can make it up to people and get a do over on your life.  You can do it.
TravelPulse|The thing about opioid addiction is that it can happen to anyone. People both young and old have been affected by it. I saw a story on the news about a young kid that went to have their wisdom teeth out and was prescribed an opioid pain medication and wound up getting addicted. I don't think that anybody WANTS to be addicted if they are in pain, but it happens. [I hope this](https://www.drugrehab.com/support/interventions/convincing-parents/) will help. It's about how to discuss rehab with your parent if you believe they need some help.Good luck to you and your family!
musical_froot_loop|I am currently reading Gabor Maté’s In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts. He does a good job explaining why some people get addicted and others do not.
Modric-87|I have the same, so my addiction says: Well you better keep on using, you are already done anyway, better have some small fun before it ends. It are all lies, you dont know whats gonna happen in the future, I try to focus on only today.
SebbyHafen|Stay strong my man, the future is bright ❤️
cherrycarnage|Yeah I get those thoughts too, best thing I try to do is distract myself with work. Overthinking just hits me harder at night when I’m trying to sleep :/
justanotheraddict81|Well u have ppl that care and if ur at a loss for caring ppl to talk to m, I’m here. Like I said I’m only on day 2 of my recovery but if I can be of any help even if u just need to vent to someone, plz feel free to message me. Us addicts in recovery need to stick together. Sometimes all an addict in recovery is other addicts in recovery. So just plz know, I’m hear!!
laughs_at_things_|I never worried about the inevitability of death, but I have had experience with obsessive, unshakable worry about something that was beyond my control.  Because that's what this seems to me.  I don't think anyone telling the reasons why you shouldn't worry about this shit will actually help you stop worrying.  It's like telling a depressed person all the reasons why they should be happy.  It's just wasted breath.I'll be honest, what finally helped me was staying away from drugs and taking prescription anti-anxiety meds, and it sounds like you're already doing that...When it comes to obsessiveness, it is possible to replace your worries with something else.  Like you can't just stop worrying, but you can replace it.  Is life meaningless?  Does that cause you pain?  Well that pain is something.  Channel that into some sort of catharsis.  Art? sports?  Whatever the hell you want, the world is your oyster.I know it probably won't help but here's my two cents on existential worrying.  You worry about your life ending because you like being alive, right?  Well, I do too, let's talk about that instead.  Kierkegaard, the quintessential existentialist, said that you have to live life before you can say much about it.  Well I say that if you never get around to saying something about it, well thats ok.  I'm alive now, and that's all I ever really wanted anyway, to be alive.
zephyrbird1111|I totally get the numbing thing. I'm pretty sure those of us who become addicts, do so because we are human & have deep hurts with no instruction manual on how to heal our emotional pain. And we are all different & we all worry about whatever we worry about. That's honestly not a very long time using, so you may be just fine. I just thought I'd share a little of what I know, in hopes of giving you ideas or calming some of the things rattling around your brain. Focus on not going backwards every day, because that will only make things worse & add more worry. I hope you have some sort of a support system, because I've learned, even if that's one person, one online group or one meeting, it's an important thing to not feel alone.
GunnerMcGrath|My recommendation would be to go find a support group for YOU that is related to your child's addiction. Alanon if they're alcoholics, naranon if they're drug addicts, etc.  These are groups for family members of addicts. The key thing here is that people don't become addicts in a vacuum, and there is often both influence from family members and an influence on the family members when an addict is involved. So just having an addict in your family means there are some things in YOU that you probably aren't even aware of, that need working out.  One very common one is enabling/codependency. I'm not saying you're a codependent just because you're considering paying your child's legal bills, but I am saying that what you think is helping them may only be serving to protect them from the consequences of their actions, which prevents them from having the motivation to change.  As long as you are bailing them out, their addiction is not their own problem, it's yours.Support groups will help teach you how to tell the difference between reasonable and unreasonable types of support, and they'll come along side you to help you stand firm in the right decisions when your child pushes back, guilt trips you, etc.
Modric-87|Thats for each one to decide themselves.
Pandadeadbear|As an 18 year old whos parents put through treatment, you have to hit bottom and realize that its life or death. You can put all this recovery on them but as the top comment is telling you: youre delaying the inevitable. They will fall unless they do it for themselves, not to appease you.
SOmuch2learn|It is not your responsibility to fix your son or daughter who is suffering from addiction. You can't.
brokenhalfjap|Yes! And let them know that you love them and support them, but you DO NOT support their habit. Give them all the love and support you can but nothing that can be used to buy drugs. Hell, let them detox on your couch. As long as they’re not using or stealing from you, be there for them.
farkalark|yes, monetary resources, but emotional support and resources do not cost anything, as long as you do not lose yourself in the process..helping takes alot.  to watch a family member go through addiction, hurts, and to offer support sometimes takes its toll, to offer good support that is beneficial to the addict, comes at a price, emotional toll, you have to learn how to do that without sacrificing yourself, but as well offer meaningful support.
florabundawonder|I would simply say that no matter how much time, money or effort you put into it, you can't help someone who ultimately isn't helping themselves.
futurepilgrim|Good luck to you and your child.
helpfulsj|I'm a recovering addict of almost 7 years, my parents have been in recovery for almost 30, and my older sister is still in prison for using.All I am going to say is that it's more important for loved ones of addicts to get help for themselves and joining a support group like Naranon, Alanon, or Families Anonymous. as well as professional therapy. It's more important for a parent to learn about how they are enabling their children to keep using, which is different for everyone. Helping your children/loved one is less about money and resources and more about setting boundaries and learning how to properly love yourself. As well as learning how you have contributed and not contributed to the problem, and most importantly that no parent has control over their kid's mental health.  Parents also need to learn that its a problem that has permanent consequences or may not ever get better regardless of how much they do for their children.
musical_froot_loop|I love this. He is still the perfect person I brought into this world. He is 22. I don’t think he is in active usage currently but he does love opioids. He’s already been through drug court. It took awhile but he finally made it out. We are in Ohio. He has met wonderful people along the way who have been really great examples of people who have come through addiction. I can’t tell you how many people have openly admired him for so many things. People have taken an interest in him. So many have demonstrated their care for him. But it’s true that it has to be what he wants. And for all the positive steps he has made, he has made some serious mis-steps. I think mental health issues are relevant as well and we are going tomorrow for an evaluation which will be a step in the right direction. I’m trying to find the right balance of support and love and recognizing whose life it is anyway.
primarybs|Yep.  That.  Guaranteed, there is something in there and once he makes peace with it..... things will get a lot easier.
GunnerMcGrath|It's not the wrong place and you are not alone. It's very self-aware of you to recognize that it feels like you are filling a void. That is a common aspect of addiction. Good luck in your search for help! You may be able to attend some AA meetings even though your problem is not with alcohol, the issues are the same.
musical_froot_loop|You’re definitely not alone. Buying something new feels good to a lot of us, addiction or not. Be gentle with yourself. This is meeting a need that you feel and you can find other ways to meet that need. Good for you for planning to find out what resources are out there.
GunnerMcGrath|http://www.nar-anon.org/ is what you want!
gogomom|r/AlAnon is a good sub to find others dealing with the same things you are.
goldprismlights|Thank you. Much appreciated!
Lulumaegolightly|Congratulations on getting clean! I really hope it works out for you. I think he is past the denial stage and knows he has a problem. Since he’s reached that point, hopefully he will be receptive to my concerns. Rather than aggressively pushing sobriety, I will definitely try to just let him know I’m there for him and worried about him and remind him that his life is worth living!!
MyDixenCider|He got clean after being in jail because he had no choice other than to be clean. If he started using after he got out means that he didn't mean to be clean. The biggest thing here that you need to learn is that an addict will not get clean or stay clean until they decide for themselves that they want to be clean. No matter how hard you try to convert them they will rebel and push further down the road. Talk to him dont be too pushy, hint at rehab or NA and he will be more receptive to it. Pushing sobriety is the last thing you want to do.
justanotheraddict81|Thnx! I hope it works out for me too! Just being there and showing u care and that ur there to support him when he decides to get clean. But be careful while he’s using, because us addicts use the ppl around us while in active addiction. Be there for him in healthy ways, don’t enable him. I hope all works out and he gets clean. Meth is a terrible drug that can turn an amazing person into....a raging lunatic. I’ve seen it firsthand. So be careful! Best of luck to u and ur brother. Please don’t hesitate to ask for further advise. I have an inside perspective into meth addiction that u don’t have. Good luck!
Deep_Thotz|Omg I am so sorry for your loss, so horrifying
SOmuch2learn|My heart goes out to you. Please find someone to talk to.
TravelPulse|I am so sorry that you are going through this. You have to be strong. Times will be tough, but they will get better. [Here's a list](https://www.drugrehab.com/addiction/hotlines/) of some free hotlines if you need anyone to talk to.
antiquespaceship|I am so sorry, please stay strong for your son and do what you can to prevent drug abuse. Stay clean and make it your purpose to identify and treat the underlying causes of drug addiction. Maybe you could make a life out of that and find true happiness through purpose and helping others
brickwallnomad|I’m terribly sorry to hear that. Must be awful. I can’t imagine that kind of pain. My heart hurts for you. However, your chances of breaking the cycle are very slim. I’m in recovery and have been clean for some time now, but I’m never promised tomorrow. Who knows if my old addict mindset will come roaring in tomorrow and next thing I know I’m right back off the deepend? So use this pain and loss, take it, own it and let it be some motivation for you to break the status quo and push. Focus. Try waking up tomorrow and not using. 1 day man. You can do it. The next few days will get worse. The next few weeks will be even worse. But then it will begin to fade and you will start to see some improvement. Maybe go to a meeting. Just for me, from my experience, I couldn’t stay clean as long as I have without somewhat regular meeting attendance. I go to NA. The hardships I faced at the beginning of my recovery slowly began to heal inside as I started to develop coping mechanisms beyond drug use. All I had known in life up until getting clean, was being high. Especially in the face of hardship. I didn’t know how to deal with emotional stress. I didn’t know how to be comfortable. Much less comfort others. Will your child be able to count on you in the future? That’s up to you. Be the person you want to be, starting today.
getyamindright|Be there for you son. Even if the family blames u that is still your child be a good person for him and make the best life for you and your son. Sorry for your lost
musical_froot_loop|I’m so sorry for your loss. I hear your pain. You didn’t say whether you also use, but if so, taking steps to getclean and sober seems like a good first step toward seeing your son again. I’m so sorry.
NiczymPuma|You have an subreddit for it? Cool, can I have a look?
thebrightorangedawn|Also interested in sub
None|[deleted]
PurpleSweetz|Much love. Thank you. You as well.
StaleToastCubes|Anytime!
brickwallnomad|Thanks man. I haven’t won yet. Getting clean is easy, it’s staying clean that u have to stay on ur toes about. No, it’s not “hard”. It’s just real easy to forget what it was like when we were using, it’s real easy for us to remember only the good times. We block out the whole reason we decided to get clean to begin with. The good times were obviously gone, for me at least. I just wanted a way out. Now that I’ve found it, I have to remind myself every so often, no matter what I do, I’ll wind up back in that mental hell if I go back.
lillypielindsay|I feel obligated to comment on this, even though by rules of the internet I should know better. Anehedonia from the post acute stage of withadrawal is very real and can last up to a year (or longer) depending on various factors. Yes, changing your lanscape, going to therapy, finding a hobby is going to help but it's certainly no cure all. You are literally battling your own brain chemistry and its inane to think someone is capable of white knuckling it through life and life's hardships based on sheer will power. Personally I did a long term methadone taper (think 5 plus years) to gradually allow my brain chemistry to return to "normal" - but I understand that's NOT for everyone. I would suggest you try it all - treat this like the disease it is. Try things to boost your natural endorphin production - excercise, sex, etc. Supplement like crazy - you are probably nutrient deficient anyway. Can't tell you what to take because every body is different but I would start with 5-htp (or similar) & l- theanine and go from there. (do your own research and experimentation here and CHOOSE YOUR SOURCES WISELY) If you need it, therapy and depression meds. Literally throw the book at it like you would any other serious illness. Try yoga, try acupuncture, try allopathic and homeopathic remedies. (make your own decisions about what works for you)Whatever you do, don't expect it to be easy but it IS possible.  You've just placed the metaphoric bag over your head and your brain is screaming for oxygen. If you recognize it as such and seek ways to ameloriate that you'll have a much greater chance of success. Much peace and luck to you, OP, and everyone who struggles.
takishan|You'll make it out fine :) just make sure you..-Get new phone number-go to NA or therapy-have people in your life that will hold you accountable-enjoy life! Sober life is really nice. Right now you're gonna be hard pressed to do anything (like you said.. Lack of motivation and depression) but believe me.. It's temporary.Start new hobbies.. You ever wanted to play an MMO? Download WoW and dive in. You ever wanted to start rock climbing? Find a gym. You ever wanted to paint? Take a class at a community college and go for it.If you actually do these things, they will reduce the chances of a relapse which is pretty much have to do if you want to stay clean.. And your life depends on it (with fentanyl mixed with everything these days.. You can never be safe as a dopehead).Good luck and ill be praying for you
zephyrbird1111|Nothing wrong with that. I talk to anyone... But I have a big, awesome, protective SO, who is scarred by his exes & their scrupulous use of social media. I am respectful of that, so as to not make him nervous, but sometimes I just read a story (like yours), that I just have a comment on, hoping to help. So, I'm glad I did. Thanks. It makes me happy to feel I helped someone get through something rough. Words are very important.
SOmuch2learn|So true.Check out, also, /r/stopdrinking.
hookdump|Great quote.Also I recommend the book “This Naked Brain”. It’s honestly amazing.
AUTO_5|Sorry, but you can never be sure in saying, "you got this."EDIT: Good luck OP!
SebbyHafen|Hey bro don't say you're meant to figure it out on your own, you're much better with people around you. You've always got more people rooting for your success than you realize. You got this buddy.
iCry2|Try focusing the time you would have spent stoned/drunk on something like learning an instrument? I've been playing guitar for years and although I still smoke, I stopped for 6 months and found my guitar and a quiet room was the perfect mix to take my mind off it. Also, try CBD oil as a substitute. It won't get you high but it'll give you a positive mental boost which will help give you happy thoughts rather than depressing ones! Good luck, you'll do find. Lots of people in the same boat here ready to offer support and listen!
thebrightorangedawn|May I ask what you mean by you "seeked counseling but don't apply"?
Savvy_Bean|This is a wonderful practice to keep. I journal infrequently whmever somerhinnnnf good happens in my life or I feel my mental illness creeping in. My memory isn't the best since using, even after being sober for a while I don't find it comes back to me so journaling is a great way for me personally to hold onto good and bad times, as well as having something to vent to when I feel I'm starting to lose myself. Somehow writing always brings me back to my center. I feel a lot of people in recovery that I've met practice this same guideline, I encourage others to as well.
492394|it is actually, how’d you guess?
AUTO_5|I'm the same way. Most of my daily vices have no noticeable withdrawal symptoms upon cessation, and I've been doing many of them for a very long time.
Modric-87|I drunk 5 liter of beer each day with 0.5 liter of wodka and I didnt get really extreme withdrawals tbh. I always binged it in a few hours, maybe it works different when you drink 24/7, my body always had some time to do emergency recovery I guess.
Stoicrecovery|A bottle of wine is about 10 units, 4 pints of beer.I'm not surprised you didn't have withdrawal. It isn't a lot. I was drinking three times that, and some people three times more than me.If you hitting a bottle of vodka a day, 30 units, 15 pints of beer, that is when it starts getting nasty.It may be also that you aren't susceptible to addiction.
clockworkbuddha|It also acts on same receptors - sometimes used to reduce alcohol withdrawal symptoms, so that might be your answer there......
Addiction_Redemption|Its reassuring that it's happened to your boyfriend as well although, obviously not pleasant that he has had to suffer through it too. It definitely feels like a test. Thankful that i have an NA meeting this evening to help me talk it over!!Thank you for the well wishes, they are greatly appreciated. Good luck to you and your boyfriend!!
sandoadonis|this happened to my boyfriend as well. it seemed like (and i do believe in karma) he was (and still is) having to deal with the aftermath of the storm he caused. now that you've made your choice, you're going to have to deal with it and the universe is going to test you. a lot! it's good. every time something happens, you prove to yourself that you can get through the stress and that you can make this happen. take it one step at a time and be thankful that you are having these experiences. it means the past is behind you. you are here now, it might be stressful but it's still good. good luck with everything!
GunnerMcGrath|My strong advice is that overcoming this kind of stuff is MUCH MUCH easier when you bring in a person or two that you trust. Telling them makes it more real, gives you more motivation, but also creates a further connection with that person which is vital because a primary driver for addiction is disconnectedness. So telling someone and showing that trust is actually part of the cure.  The idea is that you need to treat the underlying issue, of which the addiction is generally just a symptom. If you only apply willpower, you are treating the symptom.
SebbyHafen|Stay strong my man, the future is bright. You'll be ok.
farkalark|a big first step.  there may not be alot of responses, but i'm sure people are reading.
jowig|Thanks man. I do believe it is, especially after reading you guys' responses, I'm so grateful to have found this sub.
laughs_at_things_|Did you see the law & order svu about the girl who too modifinil (they called it provigil in the episode)?  She ended up staying awake for days on end, and in her delirium she killed her roommate.  Scary stuff.  Yea I like you're last line about making it real.  Admitting you have a problem is the first step.  And you sound like you have a serious problem.  I can relate.  Avoiding work, avoiding other people, avoiding your own reasonable reactions to the situation (ie stress and depression) by taking drugs.  I can relate to that borderline stimulant psychosis you've got going on, where you feel all sped up and involved in life when really there is nothing happening, and you don't produce anything worth anything.  Yea it's hard to come back down to a life that is somehow both mind numbingly boring and head splittingly difficult.  But you have to do it because that's where the real sustainable satisfaction is.  It sounds to me like you sort of already know that...Here's my experience: I ended up dropping out of school and moving back in with my parents.  Luckily they were incredibly supportive, despite the fact that I was not in a place to appreciate their help, or even really relate to them at all...  I took a year off and went back two semesters later.  Not sure if that's an option for you, but if it is, please consider it.  Don't be afraid to look like a failure.  When you're better, you'll go back to school and crush it.I think the first part of rejoining society after a solitary stimulant binge is learning to relate to others as equals.  Because that's what they are.  They have strengths and weaknesses, confidence and anxiety, and all that good human stuff, just like you.  It really helps to handle these things cooperatively, to watch how others handle their life, copy their strategies and tweak them to your preferences, discuss your anxieties, give other people advice, blah blah blah.  Human life is ridiculously complicated.  It's not designed to be done alone.Anyway, I hope this helps.  I didn't really touch on how to get off modafinil, but I'd imagine tapering off is the best way to go.  But I dunno.  Cold turkey is hard because of the withdrawals, but tapering is hard because it gives you more time to change your mind...  All I can say for certain is that getting off that shit, no matter how you do it, is the second step, after admitting you have a problem.  You can only start figuring out how to be happy again once you're clean.  Good luck my friend.
sneakypky|I have used upto 600mg a day an managed to cold Turkey it next dayI only use it for competitive edge in videogames tho.
voluntold123|Even with the anonymity that Reddit brings, it still hard to admit these things. Well done to you for making that leap.Now comes to the hard part of turning the ship around. Good luck my friend!
Dabmonkey|Yeah uhh that's pretty normal across house holds across the United States, more so other countries with legal weed laws. Literally less harmful than alcohol
Its_a_mirage_99|Marijuana becomes something you grow out of (some take longer than others) unless it truly helps a person. Many people find mind altering chemicals that improve their own sense of well-being. When a person finds something that helps them, but angers their bf/gf, they never see it as picking a substance over their loved one. It is the best case scenario that he uses marijuana (being safe), unless a doctor's alternative prescription worked out for him. He sounds like a good guy with good intentions, but out of respect and maturity he should limit his smoking sessions with friends at the house, or take it elsewhere since it obviously doesn't work for your friend in their relationship.
RosstheMoss81|Well she probably knows if its her or the weed, he’ll choose the weed. She’s accepted it and he does it responsibly...so whats the problem you have?
WaynePayne98|I know so many people that started smoking pot when they were 14 and it's f***** them up for life. I don't care if people smoke once they are done puberty but I hate the consensus that there is nothing wrong with marijuana of course it's not as bad as other drugs by any means but to say that it doesn't do anything is a complete lie if it didn't alter your brain people wouldn't take it and become so dependent on it that they need to smoke it every single day
fatalbert101|From the way it is put, it sounds like he has good intentions. However, the lying would be a problem in any relationship, regardless of circumstance. They should talk, and seek to compromise. If anything, at least agree to disagree. He does seem to have a process to not have the kids witness him highly under the influence. However, she needs to talk to him about her feelings, that it's ok with the weed, but another lie and it's over. An ultimatum would sound good here considering it leaves him with the position of both continuing the relationship and keeping his ways, versus leaving because he cannot quit lying. Communication is key here, not assumptions.
gogomom|If she is unhappy with a loved one's substance use, she can attend NarAnon or AlAnon - that will give her the tools to be happy, no matter what happens to her relationship.
redvelvetabby|That he lied about it so much. If he lies about it, what else does he lie about? Methamphetamines? There has to be honesty. It’s clear he can’t stop so I don’t know that he’s choosing the weed over her.

Modric-87|Insanely for me, in combination with other drugs.
misatum|Very, you get an instant sex drive fix
JustmyNSFWaccountTBH|That's really comforting to hear. I've honestly been freaking out quite a bit. Do you have any advice on what to look for and when I should be concerned?
aeonixx|Yes, that is my thinking. Physical dependency can take quite a while to set in. I don't know very much about this specific kind of drug, namely one that works on the adrenergic system - but I'd think that it's not very different from other systems that work similarly.Perhaps you could try Googling to see how people responded to withdrawal, and what their dosages were like.
kaymoney16|Yes, you can withdraw from clonidine.Clonidine is a central alpha antagonist, which means it works in your brain. Most commonly, you see it used for hypertension (high blood pressure). In people who stop taking their clonidine abruptly, you can see rebound hypertension - their blood pressure jumps back up higher because they’re withdrawing.Because of its central action, it also has some sedating effects. An IV drug similar to this is dexmedetomidine (Precedex) which is used for sedation in ICUs. Patients will often be transitioned to clonidine when they have been on Precedex for a while and are experiencing agitation secondarily to withdrawal.Taper yourself off. Watch your blood pressure. Don’t abuse clonidine haha
sachin0072|Hey I am a physician. I treat opiate withdrawal with clonidine at bed time to help with RLS. It is extremely unlikely to develop dependence on clonidine.Don't worry. I think you are over analyzing this.
Newmommy31|Benzodiazepines where do I start, its a love hate relationship all 5 of my duis my 2 PIs the 4cars I totaled out the couple of times I overdosed and God Still said I'm not ready.I am 31 y/o female and for the past 8 years I have battled more with benzo addiction than anything else I got very good at manipulating doctors into giving me a script last time I took them I took 32 ativan 2mlg in one night I had a script of 60. I understand the feeling of your blood boiling for something but now for the first time something changed and God showed me What death was like and I'm terrified to take any more so I suggest a lot of praying
SOmuch2learn|See a doctor so you can get help withdrawing.
only1interest|I'm sorry but you have got to stop running with benzos.  Taper if you need to (long time exposure) or throw them out and return to life.  Each day, each step with them is a step in the wrong direction that you will have to retrace someday.  Make it easier on yourself asnd everyone else by turning around now.  Get counselling if you can and think you need it to deal with underlying issues.
Deep_Thotz|Yes!! The key to preventing addiction is to manage your mental health early on. It’s good you are aware that this spiral exists in you, and are taking steps to address it.
GunnerMcGrath|It's pretty normal to run to things that make you feel good in the moment when you are feeling bad. It's really easy to go to things like energy drinks, sugary snacks (or food of any kind), drugs, alcohol, porn, video games, shopping, etc. Not all of these are inherently bad but none of them is actually doing anything to help you with your problem, they all just distract you, help you numb out for a while.The dangerous thing about these kinds of coping is that since they don't actually help you deal with the real problem at all, and often make you feel worse about yourself for doing them, now you have MORE problems rather than less. And what do you do when you are feeling down about your problems? The same thing that's making you feel bad!  So it's a crazy spiral you get into to try and numb the shame.This is why talking to a counselor is a great step, because not only does talking out your problem help you cope in a more productive, non-damaging, non-shaming way, but if the person is wise they can help you make changes that will actually improve your overall situation, which should help you get down less often.Recovery groups are great too because they help us connect with other people who understand us. We don't have to pretend we're better than we are, we can make friends who accept us for who we REALLY are, and that helps us not to be so down as well.  Connection is really the key you are looking for to break out of the cycle.
None|What you are addicted to is caffeine. Just go to any supermarket and buy caffeine pills. Get on a healthy diet. Slowly reduce your intake over next 4 months. You will be fine.
Orphansource|Energy drinks are one hell of a drug. They are so normalised and avaliable everywhere for virtually nothing. But they are super toxic, stay away bro. Whenever you need that gang busters kick just eat a banana or something
Runechi|Agreed. I’ve never thought of talking to someone. And you made me realize that I’ve never really used healthy things to cope when I’m feeling down. Never at all. I guess I’m gonna have to work on thhat too. Thanks!
SOmuch2learn|I don't know if this applies, but if there is any history of alcohol abuse or addiction in your family, it puts you at risk for alcoholism/addiction.
noahsygg|Since I got clean, I use food to reward myself. It's not good but better than the alternative.
thebrightorangedawn|The NA book would useful too since you mentioned drugs and not just alcohol. NA covers both.
yellowmush|Get the big book (Alcoholics Anonymous) and read it. Understand the program and the process. It’s honestly a wonderful message for anyone that wishes to live an authentic life. It’s a life long road that we’re all on and anyone can benefit from the tools and skills this book will show you.You don’t have to be so anxious about the what if’s. You will learn the things you have power over and the things you don’t and it will bring you confidence and peace. Good luck on your journey!
luckycatsweaters|The link says it is no longer accepting responses.
ABurlyKeel|Are you involved in a community (I used to hate that word) of sober people? Keep trying different ones until you find a group that you like.
FreneticBebop|I totally get that because that was me early on. Part of it was habit- I was used to experiencing everything intoxicated. Like, cooking a nice meal required I start drinking the wine before serving the meal. Kicking back and watching tv? Not without a drink in my hand. When I got sober, I didn't know what to do with myself, faced with all that time and no alcohol to help me out.  I had to figure out what I wanted from life and set some new goals. Since I wasn't getting blitzed, I had more productive hours in a day. And since a large part of my paycheck wasn't going to buy booze, I had a decent disposable income. So I started taking vacations to interesting places and I learned how to fix up an antique car of mine. And I discovered there were things I enjoyed just as much sober, such as seeing my favorite bands perform live in concert.
I-AM-NOT-FOOD|I'd love to know that too. What do happy and content straight and sober people _do_? I worry that I've ruined my chances of ever having fun clean and sober because I've had so many extremely euphoric experiences that literally cannot be replicated without the use of substances.(Yes. My rose coloured glasses are definitely on today.)Maybe you just learn to find things fun. Maybe it takes time. I wouldn't know as I'm still struggling myself. Really interested to know what kind of responses you get though, and I genuinely hope you find whatever it is you need to stick with it.
Littlepanda2350|Video games!
Pm_MeyourManBoobs|The sobering reality is life isn't that fun.
SOmuch2learn|Well, they saved my life, so I'm a believer.
SebbyHafen|I think a lot of it is the people you surround yourself with. Everybody experiences fun differently, so maybe try and find a good crew that enjoy spending time with?
Shitscoolwithme523|>friends:(
SmokeWeed_OnOccasion|Being out in nature is always fun for me. Especially during spring. The world is really beautiful, and I love exploring. A nice hike through the forest or up some mountains always clears my head and reminds me of the bigger picture. Plus, you get the feeling of accomplishment. State and National Parks are great if you have any around you, and sometimes the drive is worth it. You can plan a nice trip out of it, and even go camping. Bringing some friends along is always fun too!
ZissouTeam|Floating a river is always a good time.
bytivore|Metastudies have shown that they are only marginally more effective than placebo.
cvanagas|Play music. Start a band. Play shows.
gcmullans69|Find hobbies that you can enjoy with other people. Socializing with people with like minds.
gogomom|The key for me was finding sober friends to do things with.Last month we did a "closed door" amazing race type thing and it was the most fun I've had in ages.  While using, I wouldn't have even signed up for something like this.
kiramonster|Bike riding is really fun if you can find a trail that's uninterrupted by cars and is relatively safe (little to no pedestrians). Go super fast, feel the fresh air racing into your lungs, challenge yourself to see how far or fast you can go, and pack a lunch and your favourite tea/coffee so you can stop for a snack at a lookout spot. I'm struggling with this as well, and it's been winter for months and I've been battling the depression monster, or rather just letting it consume me. I find getting in touch with my inner child (not the damaged one, but the one that likes being silly and just having fun) is rewarding. Find a playground and go play on it. Go on that merry go round thingy and spin as fast as you can, swing on the swings! Dig in the dirt, build sand castles at the beach and take off your shoes. Spin a hula hoop. Those are some of the things I enjoy, anyway.
pho-sate|I'm asking the same question. It's gotten to the point where anything recreational I do I'm thinking "this would be more fun on molly/shrooms/weed" and I think it's a pretty harmful mindset because life just seems so lackluster now.
redgurl120|I’d like to be able to have fun while sober as well. And I do but sometimes u just need a release. Fitness helps because you get addicted to the high that comes with working out. But for me (getting drunk) is less work and feels better. I’m still working on it I have a few hobbies but they don’t take up all my time.
szaboelod|I don’t agree with lots of comments. It is not a great idea to start activities on your own like gaming, internet, etc. All addictions have a very similar background. Most probably you are tired when you go home. Maybe also a lot of stress at your workplace. This could be also one of the reasons: you wanted to rest and forget all the stress. You have choosen a bad tool to be happy.I would highly recommend activities which are fun, social. Like dancing for examle. Not neceserally this one, look for clues in your past. What did you find interesting in the past? You wint get the right answer here at a forum. It could be religion, football, cooking class, dancing, look for clues in your past! I highly recommend you the ted talks, books of Ken Robinson.Look for patterns what happened when you started to drink. Another great book: the power of habit. Look for the trigger, situation ehen you go to pub. What do you gain from this? Lower stress? Company? How can you substitute that?
theyreinwa|I know EXACTLY what you mean and honestly, this just takes time.  If you can afford it, try going on some extreme thrilling adventures: amusement parks, tubing, vacations, etc. etc.  I also think that giving yourself permission to veg really nice. You mentioned that you work hard. Keep working, exercising, and take care of your health.  During your off time, just chill and watch Netflix or read the internet.  You deserve to have peace. Eventually, you'll get your stride but for now, focus on staying sober and being thankful that you are not waking up with a hangover.
truthseeker2083|I like reading (almost through the 4th song of ice and fire book, since I started in August), painting, I painted and assembled a dollhouse kit a few years ago. Things like camping and hiking are fun as well. Find what makes you happy and follow your interests.
A_Real_Phoenix|No problem man, hope you get through this! I'm still in the process of breaking free myself haha
Lowkied|Thanks a lot for this bro, I really appreciate it
CrazyCatLadySLC|My pleasure! Head over to r/tea which is the greatest group of people to ever grace the internet. They'll help you on your way 😊
GunnerMcGrath|> I use quit in quotations because I wasn't ever actually really addicted.Your immediate switch from cigarettes to overeating says otherwise. You may not have been physically addicted, but clearly you are using both cigarettes and food as a coping mechanism. As you say, without them you feel empty inside. Well, the truth is that you STILL feel empty inside even with them, because what can food or cigarettes really do to how you feel deep down inside yourself? They can only distract you from how you feel, which is what addictions are often all about: escaping and numbing pain of one sort or another.So really, rather than looking for some substance or activity to help you avoid that feeling, you need to look at your life and your relationships and work on the reasons you feel empty in the first place.  I'd recommend getting a counselor if you can (don't know if you have health insurance but they are often covered) or even a recovery group. I'm sure there's overeaters anonymous or something, but even AA or NA meetings would likely welcome you in to talk about your addiction, since the addictive substance is really not the primary issue.Good luck to you!
Shitscoolwithme523|I will certainly do that. Thanks for the support my dude
Themermaidmomma|It should settle down soon I quit two months ago and now I finally have my eating under control
dimethyltripreports|Have you tried noopept? I'm not advocating it, but if by chance you haven't heard of it, maybe it's worth considering. There are anecdotal reports of smokers using it successfully to quit. It's a legal non-FDA approved drug that has overlapping binding properties to nicotine (not a naturopathic thing, an actual compound with confirmed pharmacological activity). It's not known to be carcinogenic, *based on limited research,* and isn't addictive. However, some people report a drastic reduction in withdrawal symptoms and related cravings. Perhaps it could help with cravings that transfer from one habit to another.Take the suggestion with a grain of salt, just some niche pharmacology I found interesting.
timmahsound|Bump
Modric-87|Thanks a lot!
_Icore_|Thanks for the post, it's a interesting perspective. I would love to know how it correlates to people with how they differentiate fantasy from reality
Addiction_Redemption|She's not a project! At this stage, if she doesn't want to be fixed, you can be damn well sure you won't be the one to do it!
Evilevilcow|You be sure to do exactly that!
Modric-87|An active addict cant have a healthy relationship. The substance is our nr 1 lover, everything else gets lower on the ladder. I can only speak for myself, but I really cant handle a relationship now, I cant even take care of myself. By getting in an relationship you both get expectations from eachother and I know I never ever can meet those expectation, what leads to more tension and let downs for the other, which then has a huge impact on my mental state and guess who really likes negativity and tension? My addiction. I respect you wanna help this girl, but you dont know what you are facing, or did you deal with addicts before? She needs support, not a relationship. When she has some clean time under her belt (Atleast 1 year, 2 is better) then she can think about getting a relationship. But well I know how love works, It can make you really blind and make everything seem as possible. I hope you can think with a clear head about this and make the right decision.
bolshy_yarblockos|No you shouldn't. It will not turn out well for either of you. I'm sure plenty of people will give you advice about why this isn't going to be good for you but its also important for you to know why this will more than likely end up worse for her.I lived this situation, I was that girl and met a boy who felt the same way as it seems you do. Except addiction is awful and people aren't prepared for it, as good of intentions as they may have. So shit gets real, people freak out and leave. Or they have expectations for an addict that they can't live up to, causing more emotional pain. The more you begin to love her, the harder watching her go through this will be.And you will only have two options. Jump in the fire with her and ruin yourself too or let her go. Which she won't be able to handle because she's already dealing with way too much pain. Her addiction will become worse trying to deal with it. Potentially causing irreversible damage.If you really care about her, be there for her but maintain an emotional distance. If you don't want to become her or push her further out of control, leave her be. You can't simply love people out of addiction with that being the only help they receive. If she's not ready to get clean already, she won't be ready simply because of you.
hi5torimakr|I like how you guys believe that I’m going in there like a mechanic or repair man thinking I’m gonna change parts and fix her up just because I want to. You don’t know the context of the situation and you don’t know if she wants it or not, but I can assure you this isn’t being treated as a project thanks.
littlelunacy|I think that what people are saying is true but it is coming off pretty harshly. You need to understand that you cannot in fact fix her. You both have a codependent relationship, understand that. It is also unwise to just be a “good friend” to her considering your emotional relationship. You are going to have a very hard time just being her friend, I promise you that. I have been in a similar situation and what I’m telling you is that you need to get out of this. You cannot save her and she will pull you down if you try. After a while you will come to resent her because the only person that can save her is herself. Again, the fact that you two have already been romantically involved means that the next step if you want to keep some of your sanity is to emotionally distance yourself from her. The reason why you latched on to what that other person said about just “being a good friend” is because subconsciously that’s exactly what you wanted to hear, but what you don’t understand is that it is the exact opposite of what you need right now. People aren’t telling you these things to be mean. They are saying these things because when you are on the outside looking in, things are a lot clearer. You can’t see yourself or herclearly right now, and that’s the issue. We could miss a whole lot of the story but the fact of the matter is that she is an addict and you will always come second to her addiction. That’s just how it goes. You need to save yourself. You can save no one but yourself, and as long as you remember that you will have better relationships. But the fact that you have this incredible pull to save her is less about her and more about you and the wounds that you have from childhood.  Something about her and her situation mirrors the kind of pain that you feel and the fact that you probably wanted somebody to save you, too. But I am telling you pal, this is not the road that you want to go down. Unfortunately, people telling you the same things over and over again is not going to cause you to change your mind because when you are in a romantic relationship with someone there are chemical changes that happened that cause you to be in it no matter what. Even when it is not in your best interest and in fact will take a toll on your mental health. You’re probably going to choose to go through this and that’s ok, but I just needed to repeat the same truth that others have said. When you come out of this, it will make more sense you and you will wish that you had steered clear and done the hard work. Best of luck to you.
maya_lyubomirsky|you're welcome to PM me if you want! i don't give out personal details of course but am more than happy to discuss the situation via reddit.
peterthedickeater|I can understand your attraction to her. I'm sure there is something about her that is ineffably beautiful, and I'm positive that she is worth loving.However, your title says it: this is not a healthy love. This is a "darker" love, and the truth is, she is not in the right place to deal with the emotional turmoil of a new relationship.It doesn't seem like you are trying to pursue a relationship though, which is admirable. You ask if you should "stay the course, possibly aid her sobriety and help her flourish." There is a reasonable argument for both staying and leaving; unfortunately, you don't give us enough info for me to thoroughly argue my personal opinion, so I will give you both sides.1. You stay. That's a perfectly reasonable choice. However, in doing this, you will need to be COMPLETELY SELFLESS. As in, no expectations at all for what yoru relationship with her will be during or after recovery. Addiction is first and foremost a codependency issue. An addict will absolutely not truly recover if they jump from their drug of choice straight into the arms of some lover... and the scary thing is, she might try. You have to be strong and recognize that in her case, her need for someone is NOT love, even though it might seem like it. She might try to use you as an emotional regulator, thereby turning you into a replacement drug. There's a reason why rehabs don't allow people to enter relationships. In order to recover, she needs to learn how to manage her emotions herself and deal with the issues that might have driven her towards addiction. And, to be completely honest, I highly encourage you to do some searching within yourself as to why you're attracted to someone so clearly troubled. I'm not making any assumptions or trying to psychoanalyze, but the truth is *most* "healthy" people avoid entering a romantic relationship with someone like her. There is definitely a difference between an addict and a typical working adult, and that is a typical adult is self sufficient and will not require constant work around the clock. There is just no way your love interest will be able to contribute to a healthy balanced relationship that you deserve right now. Maybe she will a few years down the line, but you shouldn't take that chance. The person she is now will be VERY different than the person she becomes after recovery. That girl might not be interested in you at all, in fact, she might be angry at you or feel like you were trying to take advantage of her in her vulnerable state. The chances of things actually working out are maybe.... 20%. And within that 20%, there's a great chance of relapse or potential suicide attempts. Try reading "A Million Little Pieces" and its sequel, "My Friend Leonard."2. You leave. You go on to pursue a girl who is much healthier and better for you, staying minimally if at all involved in the addict's life. Or...3. You stay and be her good friend. Trust me, THIS is what she needs right now, and something she will need for the rest of her life. If it helps, imagine that she is your sister, a girl you love unconditionally, and think of the advice you give her and services you render her as if they were for your sister. (these are just examples) Would you advise your sister to enter a relationship immediately after rehab? Would you advise her not to work and let a boyfriend support her? Or would you advise her to get therapy, and to call up a friend or family and vent when she is feeling bad? To keep a list of "emergency numbers" when she is tempted to relapse, etc. If you really love her, you have to love her as a person, with absolutely no expectations. DO NOT SLEEP WITH HER. Do not encourage her to sleep with others. And perhaps, perhaps, if you stay the course, and remain her very good friend for at least ten years (if she can stay sober for 10 years, she has a good chance of staying sober for good, IMO), then perhaps something beautiful can blossom...
thebrightorangedawn|Still living this situation and I am you in this story. If I could go back to the fateful day I decided to try to help and be there for "A", I would have made a VERY different choice than I did as I am still dealing with the aftermath. Addicts are addicts and always will be addicts no matter what.  If she's been to treatment multiple times before, it is improbable that this time will be the cure all. "A" had already been through multiple psych hospitalizations and 2 rehabs when our paths intersected this time (we used to work together and kept in touch a few times a year for the past 5 years). He used everything from weed, to scripts, to mdma, to cocaine, and had been using meth for about 2 months at the time of this intersect. Meth stole my Mom from me emotionally, mentally, and then physically once she died. "A" has an 8 y/o daughter and helping him escape the same fate as my mom so she didn't end up like me (I've got serious abandonment, trust, love, and other issues),  became my goal without me even realizing it. Hindsight is 20/20.In the beginning I tried to keep a distance and just be a friend, but like you I was drawn to him. With my encouragement and support, he started to get clean, he started working again, he was getting healthy again, and then we eventually started dating (BAD IDEA). He told me many of times that having me in his life took away the desire to stop using. The thing about addicts, they don't care about anybody or anything except their drug of choice and that's the truth. His using slowed down but it didn't stop like he had made it seem. When I found out, he said he would go back to treatment. I'll try to spare you the longer of the details, but that was 9 months ago. In the last 9 months he's been to rehab 5 more times and 3 psych stints. 1st - he was there for a week of detox. Came out and relapsed 4 days later. 2nd - he was there for 30 days. I went to every family day, group therapy, I did everything the treatment center said that I could to do that could help and support him including going completely sober myself so that when he got out and came to live with me there would be zero triggers at home. He relapsed 85 days after getting out. After his relapse he 51/50'd himself and was stuck in a maximum psych facility for over a week. When he got out, he then went for a 30 day outpatient program at a different, lower level psych hospital. He relapsed 3 weeks after that program. Over the course of the last 9 months I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars trying to help him. On top of that, he has stolen over $3000+ from me with most of that happening with the very last relapse. I have not seen him since his last relapse in January but I have talked to him over the phone (explanation of why is below). He has told me that when he left me after the last time he relapsed, he went back to treatment again, but he wasn't even there a full 24 hours. He had attempted suicide (and almost succeeded) and they put him on a 14 day 5150 hold in another (different) psych hospital. He called me from the psych hospital, but our conversations were not pleasant (due to the theft and abandonment) and I had decided to write him off for good. Unfortunately, that didn't last long as I shortly thereafter found out that I was pregnant so I got a hold of him to tell him (hence the phone calls).  He tells me he is now in another state in his 8th stint in rehab. He's going to attempt sober living after. I am keeping my distance at this point,  but due to my current circumstances, I am unable to completely cut him off.I tell you this story not to gain sympathy, but as a warning. I have been physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially drained because I was drawn to an addict who had already ruined all other relationships in his life because of his addiction. Because I felt bad for him, I have now put myself into a major life altering situation in which I am still trying to figure out. Addicts need professional help. What I realize now and what I'm about to pass to you is this:If somebody has been through professional treatment multiple times and is still having issues, what do you think you as a non-professional, can REALLY do to help and be there for that person?
0001none|this is very common. http://www.swansea.ac.uk/media-centre/news-archive/2017/scientistsfindthatinternetwithdrawalincreasesheartrateandbloodpressure.phpjust go by general principles of fighting addiction. avoid exposure to the stimulus and distract yourself when you get cravings
MandarinInAYear|From a perspective of somebody slightly older, please don't beat yourself up if you don't achieve everything you want by the time you are 20.You can change as long as you are alive. Changing some habits is really challenging and it's nothing wrong with struggling with them for a while. No one way works for everyone, so it may take you some time before you find what works for you, just don't give up.
OrangePiII|Thanks I just removed internet access from my technology other than my laptop for school and work. My phone and other technology didn't need it. I am going to use the next 90 days to spend less time on the internet and spend time exercising/ sports, and make new friends (and actually spend time with them). Optimistic even if this is going to be difficult.
SebbyHafen|You got this ❤️
avision|Just remember it will only difficult for so long, you'll wake up one day soon and realize you got it.
PurposedPorpoise|Hey, I've been doing exactly this for about 5 months now. In that time I've only done blow once and am now going weeks at a time without nicotine. I vaped for years, it broke so I decided to quit, bought a few packs here and there and bummed some smokes but I'm pretty much at 0 now.Changing up your habits, especially weekend habits, is crucial. Don't hang out with your friends that use. Delete your dealers' numbers. If you can, move. Try and reconnect with sober/less sketchy friends, go do activities that are fun sober. I got a dog and she really gives me the will to do better, but that's a big undertaking so I don't necessarily recommend it.When I'm really itching to do blow I remember what it's gonna be like when it's all gone. Up for hours feeling like shit, not wanting to do anything but not being able to sleep. When you think about that way just going to bed seems a lot better.It's gonna be really hard to quit both at once, they're both addictive stimulants. You're gonna be irritable and on a hair trigger sometimes. You might just wanna try quitting coke first, that's the greater of the evils.And of course, think of the money you'll save. I went from being constantly in overdraft, credit card debt, sometimes even worried about how I'd eat until payday to having savings, never going below 0 in my checking, paying my credit card in full every month. That shit feels really good.
Peoplespostmodernist|Yeah, I'm with u/mockassin. Semantics all the way. I understand the point of the article but it really does nothing to address the problem at hand. What I'd be more curious to see are studies looking at the likely babies born dependent on drugs are of developing full fledged "addictions" later in life. There's lots a data on children being prescribed  stims for ADD who grow up to become addicted to meth,coke ext so I wouldn't think it would be too far-fetched to assume that opioid dependence could be a precursor for addiction later in life.
mockassin|>Maybe you meant the ultimate impact is the samethus semantics . trying to avoid the loaded term in favor of a more benign one.
theaddictedlawyer|Since the two clinical definitions are different not sure how it can be semantic.  Maybe you meant the ultimate impact is the same.
yellowmush|🙌🏻
TNpitt-mama|I would try [SMART Recovery]( https://www.smartrecovery.org).  They offer an alternative to AA/NA but Smart Recovery is evidence-based and does not revolve around religion/spirituality.  I would check out their resource section, should be plenty of tools available for free or you can order a $10 workbook of the same material. They also list additional readings that may be useful to you. They have online & local meetings, in some areas at least, if thats your thing. I copied the following from their website:SMART Recovery is the leading self-empowering addiction recovery support group. Our participants learn tools for addiction recovery based on the latest scientific research and participate in a world-wide community which includes free, self-empowering, science-based mutual help groups.
JayMaya|Wow. You've been through Hell. I think you are doing the right thing but cautioning yourself. I understand you love her but sometimes it's important to feel safe more than feeling that love. Safety matters for your kid more than anything.She may be clean now but that 'unknown, scared' feeling to live with each day by giving her that 2nd chance back into your life as your partner is not worth it, in my opinion. I just got out of a relationship with an addict (i am 23F, he was my BF in middle school too we have a very deep connection/relationship). I realized, i'd rather break my heart ONCE and heal with time, or learn to cope with the heartbreak, than have my heart break each and every day by being with him. I believe that we are deserving of healthy lifestyles. It sucks that we are capable of falling in love with people who have a mental disease. These people are not inherently bad people, but they do have a disease that actually makes them bad people, unfortunately.
Paask_en|Honestly wish I could help here, but I'm too young to give any advice on marriage and especially when there's A kid involved, but it sounds like you need her to really prove herself, be completely honest and see if you can end up trusting her again, because if you don't and you end up together, you'll probably just keep being suspicious and think about all the bad stuff, and it'll make you miserable (only talking from experience of extreme trust breach in A previous relationship, but again, quite young, so probably not the same as your situation at all)...Hope you find out something for the sake of you and your kid, and hope she gets better too and that she's changed... Wishing the best of luck and positive thoughts to you, your kid and her! Wish I could give better advice
SDsurfx|Wow, great perspective from someone so young. Me heart has slowly been breaking all those nights she was gone. I’ve slowly been emotionally detaching. Feels tough to go back. I don’t even feel like letting her touch me most days.
florabundawonder|In my opinion you have already done more than many people would. For the sake of yourself and your child you are doing the right thing. You can't "fix" her - she has to do that for herself. I was an addict before I got with my now husband, and he told me that if I was to carry on using or go back to it, he would never be able to be with me. I did not doubt him for a second and I have been clean since. It was something I wanted to do for myself anyway but his firm stance on it really helped me. Stick to the course you're on, be a good dad, facilitate her seeing the child under supervision if she stays sober. But don't go back to her at this point in time. She has lied and cheated, made bad choices and put your child at who knows what risk? She needs to see that there are heavy consequences for that. Be strong.
twinkie45|You’re playing with fire here because at a certain point CPS will take the child if you keep allowing your wife to come home and she keeps relapsing. I’m not saying you have to give up on her or all hope is lost, but you have to protect your child before you worry about your marriage. I’d consider requiring her to live elsewhere with a set plan/schedule to rebuild your family. It should include family and individual counseling for all of you, only supervised contact with your child, and random drug tests from Walmart/drug store. If she can meet all of the conditions without a relapse for anywhere from 6-12 months you can talk about her coming home.
witherspleen|I put an ex partner through a hell that was not as severe as this, but it still wasn’t pretty. I never managed to get fully clean and sober until almost a year after we broke up (her call, and a good call). But the years of slowly increasing lying and hiding and denials and counter-accusations, even after I had given up booze for the last half year or so, had done its damage. Even if we had stayed together, with everything that my addictions put us through, I don’t believe we would have ever recovered to the point of it being a healthy, balanced relationship. That was six years ago, the last over five of which I’ve been clean and sober. Looking back on it now, I can definitely say it was the right call. Had it gotten much worse, it would have ended sooner and in a more explosive fashion rather than the way we parted ways, on quite good terms. I can’t imagine how having a kid together would have impacted that, but for you, I think staying together  even for the sake of raising a kid would be stopping you from finding truer happiness wirh a life partner. If she is truly clean and sober, and you can stay friends or at least on good terms if you end the relationship, there’s no reason not to in my mind, as sad as I feel recommending that. Even if you can’t stay on good terms, if you realize that you can’t spend the rest of your life growing old with this person, you better pull the plug on trying to make the life-partner end of it work, and look at some options to move forward. The kid complicated things, but I’m sure you’re both committed to raising your child in the best way possible. And that probably involves being in a healthy relationship. Which may not be with each other.
JohnnyBumBum|Thanks for your input. I’m asking because I’m trying to figure out why my mental health and personality/mood has somewhat changed over the past two years. Before my last relapse about two and half years ago my best friend died from an overdose so I’m wondering if that played any roll. I’m interested to see if a doctor would diagnose me with PTSD so I could receive medical marijuana as though I feel like I would benefit from it.
dimethyltripreports|Mental disorders are fluid. The medical classification of them is a tool for human understanding, but is not necessarily representative of the nature of the mind.PTSD describes a severe, chronic anxiety disorder that results from a particular bout of trauma. It is not for doctors to say what kind of trauma is capable of causing a subsequent anxiety disorder. The brain reacts in many ways, and the experience of trauma is, to some degree, subjective.So yes, a traumatic experience of any kind, including the emotionally intense context of an opioid addiction, can give rise to PTSD. Healthcare professionals may not consider this as true PTSD, because drug use is involved, so they will attribute the anxiety to the drug use. However, this ignores the basic workings of the brain. Trauma is subjective, and can be tied into many experiences, including addiction.Why do you ask?
ikindofhateyou|Yes, I have been talking to my doctor lately about the months before I got sober. I still have nightmares about it, I break down even mentioning it, I feel shame and guilt and I go to this other place and just panic.  Mentioning it just makes me go into a full breakdown sometimes.  That's with alcohol and I almost died and have a lot of amnesia from the event. I don't know if that helps you but I think addiction itself and how you got there is extremely tramatic.
NiczymPuma|Have u tried beacon? I don't really have an idea in how to help you other than trying to change your eating habits, u can go drastically and try being and vegetarian for a week and see how you feel with it. How long can your last without salami?
ThatGuyKacper|Do you live with anyone? if so, they could stop you from eating salami.
igottahavemypops|try snorting the salami so it reaches your bloodstream quicker
ronald_rousey|Cut the bread
Fun-Zilla|I went through the same thing. Stay strong, keep busy, get out of the house for a walk, the gym or go to the library to read. That is what helped me. I just used my place for sleep when I was feeling tempted.
GunnerMcGrath|You've gotta be open with your parents so they can help you. If they don't already know about your drug use, then I recommend getting an AA or NA sponsor and start working your recovery with them, and talking to that person about your situation. It's not always best to just come right out and say that you're an addict to your parents, but you're in recovery now and trying to do your best, so chances are it will not be a horrible conversation.If they do know already, then you just have to tell them the things that are tempting and ask them to help you by putting things where you can't get to them. The beer in the fridge might be the toughest part because your parents may not like the inconvenience, but it's fair to ask them to make a sacrifice for their health of their son.Chances are they are just clueless about what it's like for you and being open and honest will make a world of difference.
Modric-87|They dont know that you are addicted and beginning to use might end up on the graveyard? Better inform your parents.
kellywynne_|They know. They just don’t care or respect it because it’s their house. I’ve asked them to not have it out in the open. It made no difference honestly. They’re not bad people. They just don’t get it. I need to get a sponsor though. Thank you.
kiramonster|That's unfortunate. I guess the expectation of parents looking out for their child's best interest is unrealistic sometimes. People aren't perfect and, well, I don't know what else to say. I have my own resentments to deal with and hearing this just brings that shit up. Oh well, if it's temporary then at least you have something to look forward to. Be strong, you know the drill. It's ultimately up to you to stay dedicated to your path of sobriety. I sincerely hope for your success!
sh0nuff|I'm sorry you have to deal with that sort of situation. My parents are some of my biggest supporters... They didn't even drink in front of me, and my mom still keeps various medications for me (like when I broke my leg and didn't want to trust myself with opiates)If you live with them, perhaps you can take the perspective of thanking them for the support they do give you, as a way into communicating the discomfort that it creates.. even bringing it up is difficult.
EllafromTBC|That's very inspiring. Thanks for the post!
BenSunhoof|Thank you so much for the advice, I’ll keep it in mind.
BiBiches|Hopefully I didn't go too overboard. I know a lot of this isn't relevant but I felt a little background might help. I hope my advice actually helps or gives you some ideas of what to do.
SOmuch2learn|One of the most life changing things I have learned is that I cannot control another person. Trying to help someone who doesn't want help is a waste of time. I understand that you are concerned and with good reason. My dad and youngest sister died too young because of nicotine addiction. There is lots of help available to stop smoking if she wants it. Doctors can prescribe medicines and some states, like WI, provide free services. You could refer her to /r/stopsmoking.
SporkPepper|just be there to listen. dont enable her in any way. maybe offer to make her dinner? i wouldnt goo for any big grand gestures. keep things cool and maybe casually mention that you're there for her if she needs help. I would stay away from phrases like, "if you need anything.." because "anything" can be misconstrued. This is a very sensitive and confusing time for her and if needed or appropriate, try to be clear and straightforward about any expectations you have of her and your friendship going forward.
_lifeisabattlefield_|Do not enable her. Offer to help her find a rehab or program.
uglyrabbits|I’ve ODed a few times, but mostly in my late teens / early 20s. I’ll never forget when a friend brought over some movies the day after my last attempt and just hung out with me. He just treated me like the friends we were. He brought the virgin suicides and suicide club (Japanese version) which honestly made me laugh and feel normal for the first time in a long time. That was 20 years ago. It meant so much to me that I still think of it nearly every day. Everyone else JUDGED ME. If that’s all the support I had, I would have tried again immediately. People like to have rules of what and what not to say to people when that happens. I have experienced the entire spectrum. Don’t worry about all this triggering ‘say this don’t say that’ bullshit people are saying. Treat your friend like you always have, and definitely take time to hang out like you have in the past. I think your friend needs someone to confide in, not be scolded by. It will mean everything, I promise. Just go to a movie or whatever you normally do. BE NORMAL and he/she will know that means you care about who they are no matter what.
AmazingAnxiety|Read this post on my successful method, maybe it can help you too, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/842ljs/my_successful_way_of_dealing_with_addiction_maybe/)
Modric-87|Sex is the main drive why I use cocaine. It started all socially, ended up watching porn and camsites for 10 hours straight a day. Im an addict, i can get addicted to everything as long as it let me escape life. It totally fucked up my sober sex life aswell, its just not enough anymore. Visit a SLAA meeting if you want its for sex addicts. The longer you keep doing this, the more it will tighten the grip on you. Take care my friend.
_throw_away_away_|I will try this. Forced positive phrases and thinking helped me out of a depression a time ago. I never thought about trying it on the something like this
lemasney|Hope is a delicious feast. May you be satisfied. Thanks for the kind response, and we wish you quiet resolve.
SigNinja|Sure, send him to rehab. But read every book you can find on addiction recovery. Show your son you care. Love will cure him, not strangers.
rainnydays|I know . He had seizures three weeks ago trying to withdraw cold turkey.  I’m really interested in info on American Addiction Centers. They are offering inpatient treatment immediately at very little cost. Their reviews are mixed. Looking specifically for people who have worked with them. Thank you though.
sharpy111|Call around and get the opinion of local addiction counselors maybe they can help. Xanax is a benzo and those can be life threatening to withdrawal so a hospital/Rehab. is a must.
AmazingAnxiety|Read my last post maybe it can help you too, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/842ljs/my_successful_way_of_dealing_with_addiction_maybe/)
Darkwing_Dabs|I would say think of others it's so easy for us to beat ourselves up and seem worthless. One drink, one bump, or one puff who gives a f I'm a POS. Your not your an amazing person and if you lose this fight you'll be survived by the ones who love you the most. I recently lost a close friend this week to heroin overdose they were found hours later and although they survived their brain did not. They will be pulling this person's life support in a few days. We went to the hospital to say our good byes and it was so surreal to see friends I haven't seen in years all there. Even with out brain activity your body goes through withdrawals so they move open there eyes even seem to react. They're gone though, this person left behind a very young son. Seeing the feeding tube and respirators was absolutely heart breaking. I've been friends with this person for about fifteen years and even to the end I tried to encourage them. Everyday is an accomplishment and a gift. We're all so proud of you Everytime you make a good choice. Let the good out weigh the bad. Ask for help and never be afraid to fail. If I could of I would have quit my job and just watched this person for the rest of time but this is not the world we live in. This person was troubled they loved so easy and hurt just so, I know now though that my friend is at peace from the harsh realities in which this world can lead us to. Fight for yourself and fight for your family. If you need anything I mean anything please  pm me. I'm here to help, we all are. You and your family deserve it.
GunnerMcGrath|Don't think about ever again. Just get through today. That's all you have to do. And no, you're not at all alone with that feeling. Get into some community with people who understand. NA is a good place to start.
Modric-87|Nice man, we aint quitting either!
PurpleSweetz|Well yeah, you can't do it by yourself (meaning without the help of another recovering addict).
Ringoateyourbaby|Thanks. And sorry to hear about your friend. It’s sickening how addiction can make us disregard all of our loved ones. How the temptation of a temporary escape from our feelings and reality can have so much power over our minds that we would risk losing everything real and good in our lives..
Schnitzel8|Don’t think about the rest of your life. Just make this your mantra:*I won’t use today*That’s much less stressful than worrying about the rest of your life. We can deal with tomorrow tomorrow. All the best buddy. You got this!
SporkPepper|maybe abstinence isnt for you. maybe traditional treatments arent for you. I just finished a wonderful book called "Recovery from Trauma, Addiction, or Both: Strategies for Finding Your Best Self" maybe, for you, it's not about complete sobriety, but more about getting better?all i know is that there's more than one way to skin a cat. hang in there, good luck. ask for help and accept it - as much as you possibly can. you'll find the way.
TrumpwonHilDawgLost|It’s not impossible. At all.Trust me.
futurepilgrim|Been there. Honestly, the answer to your problem is simple. It sounds stupid but it’s actually really useful - and not just in the realm of addiction - and the underwhelming advice is... don’t worry about it. Worry about right now. Worry about today. Tomorrow and after that, the rest of your life will work itself out one day at a time. Quitting for the rest of your life isn’t realistic. Not using for the next 24 hours is do-able. Focus on what’s coming next and you can have a great life!
Flowolf66|Go to NA meetingsYou'll never be alone if you create a sober network of non judgemental people who know or can relate what you're going through.You cannot fight addiction alone. Addiction will always win in the long run..Go and get yourself through those doors and feel the love in those rooms.Thanks yourself later and remember,Keep coming back!
SebbyHafen|My man, you can do it. You're not alone. Stay strong!! Keep us updated yeah?
Bacon_Hero|Second this. If he's not you aren't going to make him.
Deep_Thotz|First find out if he’s interested in quitting
Leonardothedog|Thank you. I’ll watch it now. His problem is my problem and I can’t just look away. Chris wants to have a normal life so I’ll take a stand for him.
walt1o82|Don't listen to the below comments.Watch this Ted Talk https://youtu.be/PY9DcIMGxMsContinue giving him social interactions and see if you can discuss a purpose for his life.Note the difference in US drug deaths etc and Portugal, now that Portugal is treating it as a public health problem rather than a criminal problem where the addict has a "choice" (hence ignore the above comments). If he had a choice, he wouldn't be addicted. It's literally the dictionary definition of addiction- not having a choice to use.Addiction is a behavioural brain disease where the addict has no choice but to use. Detoxes can help stop them using short term but without long term support to build what Hari talks about in his Ted talk, then they can fall back into their addictions.You wouldn't ask someone to choose not to have cancer- even though they might not have exercised much, may be overweight, may have smoked at one point in their life etc... all life choices. They just didn't know it was going to lead to cancer.Same with addiction. Most people drink but don't become alcoholics. It's just society views addiction as a moral choice rather than an illness.
AmazingAnxiety|Well, it is possible. But I've two remarks on that, one: Even if that is true, it might still help those people who are in a similar situation as me, those who truly want to end their addictions but can't. If I stopped doing this I would just relapse after a while because I've never found any other method that works.Two: You are not really promising that *you will end your addiction*. Everytime you are just taking a small step, promising only that *you will avoid your addiction just for one day*, which you might truly want to do.
Columbusquill1977|Shrug. Honestly, dude, whatever works.
Modric-87|Im gonna try this stuff, thanks man.
SebbyHafen|That's pretty cool!!
SigNinja|This is great, going to try this thanks!
citrum_|The reason why this works for you, is because of this:>''...really meaning the words you say.''If only everyone really, sincerely and truly wanted to end their addiction. But it's hard to *sincerely* want the opposite of what your brain sincerely needs. That kinda renders it not as sincere, then.
gogomom|It's a nice affirmation.  I can see how the daily use of it reaffirms your desire to stay clean.
kiramonster|Renewing your commitment to your sobriety like this actually makes sense. You aren't just _thinking_ about staying sober, you're doing a thing and doing things help you remember that you did them, whereas thoughts fly around all day long and can easily be forgotten or dismissed or argued away. Marry your sobriety and renew your vows daily. Why not?
Modric-87|Porn is a harddrug. Watching porn gives you a huge dopamine spike just like cocaine does. So you are in the right place mate. I am addicted to it aswell, icm with other substances. Its pretty special that I can openly talk about my addictions, but porn is still taboo most of the times, altho I know its my biggest addiction. You can visit a SLAA meeting if you like, its for sexaddicts and its free. Have you dealt with addictive behaviour in your past? (Like binge watching, fitness, food those kind of stuff) I also read books by Patrick Carnes, really good books for sexaddicts.I hope you get out of it my friend, you are not alone.
Cavallin|Thanks for support and Yeah reason I didn’t include this was because I don’t have a habit of browsing reddit only for the principle of browsing. Sometimes It feels like I scroll through the same Instagram posts endlessly..And it’s insane how big this is, this social media addiction is a societal problem really, everyone is addicted more or less
Lalileluloyo|I'd say reddit is social, even if you don't post or interact with anyone, it's like being invisible in a group conversation, it's still social. I'd suggest either always carrying a book or a pen and journal. You'll be surprised what you write or how much you'll read.
nunyabiz3345|Congratulations ! , right there with ya, never had snap chat, instagram was deleted long ago, FB is gone, this is all I'm left with and , this isn't really social.
Modric-87|She gotta want to quit for herself, or else it aint gonna happen. Im sorry man.
Sorella126|We can’t kidnap her, she’s 22... no rehabs will take her if she doesn’t want to be there and no one in my family has the medical expertise to be able to get her safely through even the beginning stages of withdrawal. I also work in the same building as a police station and I asked them hypothetically what could be done and they said she could press charges against us for keeping her against her will and that we could get her arrested to force her into drug court but then she would be a felon and have a drug charge on her background
avision|*I am not saying you should do this* But a 9-12 day "retreat" under supervision from you or someone you trust with some subs should be sufficient enough to come down without much pain, "much", say 24mg total, split up. This was enough for me to break the dependance, it was, however, not enough to break the addiction, that comes with quite a bit more time. Step by step, day by day, hour by hour, episode after episode, movie after movie, it is different for everyone. For me, an addicted idle mind was my worst enemy. I am no doctor, I just have little experience kicking on my own. I wish her and you the best.
nunyabiz3345|she's your family, you should kidnap her for her own good and get her clean
Pm_MeyourManBoobs|Thank you
SmashMouthIsGood|Thanks man (or woman), really appreciate you sharing your experience. I actually am on a low dose of ativan for social anxiety but have never really struggled with benzo dependence as much, although many of my friends have. I've been trying to get back into exercising more regularly, but I'm also concerned about my heart rate/blood pressure when I'm on any dose of bupropion/vyvanse. It has helped tremendously with depression in the past though. Haven't looked into dieting, but I'll definitely do some reading. I'm trying to wean myself off of it for now, considering I have a hugely important job interview in a week and don't want to be a total mess. Hopefully I can cut it out completely for a few weeks afterwards and start feeling like myself again. Fingers crossed. Thanks again for giving me some hope.
ririrodina|I'm a lady actually ... lol :pHow has your experience with ativan been? I've noticed that when I took it on a daily basis I had some personality changes when I didn't take it. I was on the lowest dose by the way. I over think things alot though.That's a very valid concern, maybe purchasing a fit bit can bring you some relief so you can check on your stats. Hearing that I brought you some hope put a smile on my face. I remember the first time I reached out on Reddit I was so shy but I really needed to talk to someone about what was going on, and the people I know irl weren't really the ones I wanted to reach out too. I'm not sure why still... I'm glad I did because there are some gems on Reddit and they helped me out alot.Interviews are pretty nerve wrecking as it is and it totally makes sense to cut down after wards. I don't know you but you sound professional and put together so I have a feeling you'll rock it!
Deep_Thotz|Addiction stigmas are horrendous.Wait until your in a safe trusting space with her before revealing. Best of luck.
GunnerMcGrath|I'm really sorry to hear that.  I should point out, though, that I was speaking of recovering alcoholics, and what I guess I really meant is people with some length of sobriety already under their belts.  I can imagine some judgmental people shaming you for needing help (despicable as that is), but I have a much harder time imagining people being judgemental toward someone who has been 5 years sober.  Overall people seem very supportive of such individuals.I think we can all agree, though, that everyone should be extremely helpful and encouraging to anyone seeking help, no matter where they are in their journey, because they've already recognized there's a problem and want to stop.  This kind of judgmental behavior only keeps people in a shameful place of secrecy where they are afraid to reach out. No wonder we have an epidemic of child molestation.
Lazy_Exorcist|See I have had a very different experience. I have been openly shamed for my alcohol addiction by friends and family. I was fired from a job for seeking treatment. Due to this, I tend to keep it to myself until I feel comfortable and have complete trust in that person.
OGBilly-Bumbler|This is absolutely something I needed to hear as well.  This just hit me hard.  Thank you.
PurpleSweetz|Fuck the stigma. Be comfortable with who you are - better yet, be fucking proud dude. No one couldwalk a foot in your shoes let alone a mile. You're a fucking beast.
SebbyHafen|Tbh I feel like she'll care more about who you are than who you were. I would hope she would respect you more for overcoming it
SporkPepper|now-ish is good ;) good luck, and congrats on your recovery.
afolgate|I feel like you are speaking for me, well put.
gogomom|I think you should tell her ASAP.  My reasoning isn't as nice as the other posters.  I have been in recovery for over 7 years.  I am also  married over 20 years to a relapsing alcoholic (at this point I guess I should just call it active).  I am committed to my marriage and even though it's a kind of hell I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, I have found ways to deal by setting strong boundaries.If something were to happen to him, I would not, under ANY circumstances get involved with anybody who even had a HINT of addiction issues.  This is my choice (and as a recovering addict - I get the hypocrisy) and even though it's not "nice" I would move on.I believe you owe this woman the opportunity to decide about a relationship with you with ALL the facts.
infectedL|I say you should tell her by now. I would want my partner to honest with me.
vladthedracul|Tell her, I've ended many relationships and pushed people away just because i didn't want them to know/find out.
HavocsReach|Good shit man! You can do this you are stronger than your desires
Schnitzel8|Hey man. Read your post. You seem like a really smart guy so I guess there’s no real advice I can offer that you haven’t thought of already. But I will say this: I know addiction and it’s fucking horrible. But I also know recovery and it’s fucking amazing. We both know you can beat this thing (with or without completing your studies). It’s just a matter of cold hard commitment one day at a time. Good luck buddy! You got this.
TravelPulse|Sounds like you also know things that trigger your response to sliding down the hill a little bit. If you've found the strength to stay clean for a few years, you can definitely do it again. That's a really big accomplishment you made. Yeah, you can send me a message.
afolgate|I’m not reading your fucking post stop being a little div and don’t even think about giving into your urges, you will ruin your life.I hope that helps don’t do itEDIT: I READ ITYou actually sound very similar to me and my life story. Don’t fucking do it man.  Guess what mate? You don’t have to study if you don’t want to. You don’t have to do ANYTHING anyone tells you.I suggest you book a week or two holiday abroad alone somewhere, come back and tell people about your adventures. Then when you’ve been back a week, decide if you want to be a druggy or if you want to be able o have nice things like travel. Fuck the studying mate it’s not working for you
sukcessfulfailure|Thank you man. I appreciate the disclosure and advice more than you can imagine. And thank you for the recommendation, I’m going to watch this now. I know exactly what you mean too. I’ve realized you are right. The connections I made while sober with my co-workers, the purpose of having a job, the empowerment from having money..I believe all of that led to my happiness. And just as you surmised, I lost all of that because of school. It’s true, I have no connections at school. I cut off all my ties with local friends because they are just completely strung out and I can’t be around them. I feel completely alone because I can’t talk to my family either about these things when I need someone to talk to. When I was just working on staying sober and keeping my job it was easy for me. I had no desire to use anymore. No cravings. Nothing. It all came back with a vengeance in school. I feel it might be related to my heavy use during high school and community college. Perhaps I subconsciously connect school with drugs..I don’t know why I feel this way in school because I’m not a bad student. I get good grades..even impress my teachers with my writing abilities. It’s just all so empty to me. It doesn’t carry any meaning. I desperately want to finish my schooling and get my degree because I know, in the end, it will make me feel great about myself. It’s just the fear of the damage I will do again in the mean time. I’m afraid that if I make the drastic decision to drop out and focus on myself and sobriety again that it will just compound my depression when I realize I gave up and made no progress again. It’s a slippery slope because either way it’s a bad decision, in my opinion..I’m honestly not even sure what I’m expecting to hear but hearing I’m not alone makes a world of difference. I did manage to go to class today and stay sober. You’re also right about being proud of the experience. I feel like the places my addiction took me to, the lows, the disparity, all for me to come out triumphant in the end made me a much better person. I saw myself become extremely compassionate and empathetic. I found happiness in helping others. It just wore off on me. And I made a huge mistake going back to drugs..but the fact that I can even see this and admit it gives me hope. I know I can find the strength to get myself out of this mess again. I just wish I could force myself to do it right now. But I do feel happy I made it through just one more day. At least I came out triumphant this one day again. Hopefully I can repeat the process enough times until it becomes natural again. Anyway. Thank you for your response. Truly.
walt1o82|Relapse is part of the addict's journey unfortunately. Every relapse is an opportunity to learn though and grow understanding of your condition. The philosopher Alan Watts frames the initial realisation that you can never use again under any circumstances (Hari's ratpark is how to remain sober)Search YouTube "Alan Watts Accept it, and you'll be good at it".I'd advise to listen and ignore whoever's put the video together.Glad to hear today went well :)
DenMother8|First of all - CONGRATULATIONS! You can find new friends the same way anybody finds new friends, do things that interest you -  go to class (not just Academic, maybe something in the arts or something physical like a sport) … Go to meet up’s or other social events. Good luck - you may want to change jobs &/or move if possible.
OGpizza|Find some volunteering options in your area. Helping homeless, tutoring English, etc...not only will you make a new hobby that keeps you occupied to avoid relapse, you’ll meet people will similar interests and create new friendships. Say yes to these people when they have ideas for stuff to do outside of the volunteer setting. Eventually you’ll get to know them at a more intimate level and you can start suggesting things. Even later you can drop the volunteering altogether (unless you want to continue, then by all means keep at it!) and voila, you have a new circle of friends.
SebbyHafen|^^ yeah volunteering is good, local rec league sports,  maybe take a class from a local community collegeYo, and like...I'm Mormon af and not trynna convert you or anything, but there's always a good crew of 20 something year olds wherever you live who plan activities n shiz like once a week, doesn't matter whether or not you go to church or whatever. Good crowd to hang around. I can hook you up if you're interested.
okcomputer14|Where do you live? My home group is essentially all people in their early - mid twenties.
Cwellz123|Yeah I’m at 67 days clean and I still think about getting high. It’s going to take more than 8 days for your brain to go back to normal.
Modric-87|Im in the same mindset. I so recognize that covering up the using, so our loved ones can relax a little and think we are doing ok. I feel like a total douche to be honest about my using, because when im open about it too them, in no way I can promise them I wont use again. Its a fucked up paradox guys.
PurpleSweetz|You shouldn't worry about step work at 10 days clean. Your mind is still raging for more drugs. You should just focus on remaining clean from the drugs at all costs.
Sushisavage|I first admitted it to myself a little over a year ago. Been on and off in recovery programs since then. I was out of recovery completely from June-November and hit a bottom in November and started trying again. Fifty days was the longest clean time I've had. Now I'm at 10 days. I'm proud of myself though. I use drugs way less than I used to... that has to count for something. Lol. I don't know you or what you've done but I doubt you're a bad person. You're a person with an addiction. Addictions are fucking hard to quit man. Maybe try going to 12 step meetings and just listen. Even if you don't want to get clean at this point, just go and listen. That's all I've really done. I did get more sober time when I started doing the steps and got a sponsor, though. No rehab for me. I still hope to use and drink again sometime, just not today.
Turrbo_Jettz|You aren't ready for recovery yet from the sounds of it. You have to WANT and NEED Sobriety with every fiber of your being!
michael-satterfield|I guess that makes sense... I would suggest getting with more women in recovery. Check out some women's meetings and maybe get to know your sponsee sisters. Personally even when I was dating another person in recovery, it wasn't the best thing to rely to heavily on each other. It's too easy to start getting high together
woods8189|I like to think am not a bad person but some of the things I've done high would make me a bad person, so does that make me a bad person coz i took the drugs know it could make me in to a dick head, I struggle with that little conundrum for a while now.   It was 6 years ago for me when I first admitted to myself and started looking for professional help. They don't really do the 12 step program were am from. We have a service to help people out of addiction am engaging with them on a one to one basie, never had a group meeting yet tho, Am worried about the group meeting don't know why Yes I would say it totally dose count the amount of drugs your using. 6 year ago I was bang at everything everyday whatever i could get my hands on. 6 year later I might still be using but at least there are no class A involved anymore When I read that you still hope to use and drink someday, again exactly how I use to think, after 6 years of trying I now know that when I finally do stop it will have to be forever. Because use addict just can't handle are drugs and ruin are lives, there's no take it or leave it for us. Its just leave it. Its a scary thought it shits me up know that one day I will never take another drug again. I miss them already thinking about that and I've not even got totally clean yet
GunnerMcGrath|You're an addict, your girlfriend isn't. You're going to have to accept that you can't do drugs casually and not get obsessed. Also your girlfriend, as a non addict, is taking drugs because they're medicinal and they have uses. You're using them for recreation and to escape. That's not what those are for.Go to NA meetings. You'll learn so much about yourself just listening to others talk.
Monstiemama|This is amazing advice. Thank you.
SkyR923|I too used to experience the overwhelming urge to use drugs. It’s called being an addict. That’s what we do. I’ve been so addicted to drugs before that it completely fucked my life. I sat back and watched my whole world wither away in front of me. Then I decided I wanted to get clean, I wanted to *live*.That’s what you need to do. You need to find out who you really are without drugs. It’s not easy, trust me I know. But if you really want to get sober, you have to find I within yourself. At the end of the day, nobody can truly help you get clean other than yourself. Think about how you feel without drugs. Pretty shit, right? Well you don’t want to live that way forever. What kind of life would you be leading if you had to have drugs in order to feel okay? It’s just not healthy man. I encourage you to get some professional help. You are already taking the right steps by admitting you have a problem. You can get over this!! If I can, anyone can. Don’t let substances control your life. You are stronger than them. Although it may not feel like it, you are. You have the power to put an end to this. My heart goes out to you man, I was in your exact position once. I would go over to visit relatives and search all around the house for some type of drug. Usually I would just find the liquor stash, take some shots, and water down the bottle. I know this isn’t easy. But it’s worth it in the long run, your mind and body will thank you. These things take time, it doesn’t happen overnight. But please change something about your lifestyle. You don’t have to quit drugs all together, you can smoke weed and drink and do whatever and be relatively safe as long as you moderate. Life is meant to be lived sober. Don’t do this to yourself man.Good luck to you
dimethyltripreports|There's no easy solution. But one aspect of it is to actively work to change your perspective. Start with reframing your efforts - instead of battling an addiction, work on developing discipline. They're essentially the same thing, but still different in quality. Change your internet searches and overall mindset to reflect that. It's small, but it's real.
walt1o82|You've developed tolerance. Xanax has a really short half life out of all the benzodiazepines. You need to slowly switch over to diazepam which has a much longer half life- up to 100-200 hours in some individuals. Google Dr Ashton Manual Benzodiazepines. That will give you all the knowledge you need to get out of where you are. If you have a decent doctor, take it to him/her and show them. Be honest, show them where you are. Get settled on where you are on your dosage then start cutting down. The good news is that you can manage it all and get off it.The bad news is that it will take time, depending on how much and how long you've been dependent. Your brain hadn't been producing GABA because it's been produced artificially by xanax etc. You'll need to come off the benzodiazepines slowly to give your brain time to start producing GABA again on it's own. But again, good news: your brain will get back to it- it just might take time.One more piece of advice: don't Google benzo addiction withdrawals. The act of doing that will give you withdrawals even if you've not taken a benzo in 4 years- trust me!Good luck :)
xluzibelx|Looks like you have a tendency to develop of addiction, unlike your girlfriend. What should you do to stop? Well, Im still figuring out myself too, but something I can tell you is you have a problem. In the moment you decide to stop and keep doing it, means addiction's growing inside you so either or you go seek for some help NOW or just hide it from the ones around you until it becomes to obvious for them to catch something weird on you. Ending up dead or locked up are some options too. To be honest, beating up addiction alone is as bad as playing russian roulette with a revolver. It depends of course in how grown your addiction is, but if you seriously can't stop by yourself, seek help now before it's to late! I did the same mistake to wait as you and overdosed and nearly died! Doctors said it was a MIRACLE to had woke up with almost not real damage, but a friend of mine who went through the same shit that same night couldn't make it. He passed away.So I'll encourage you to seek help, it's for the best! Best wishes
Modric-87|You are in the right place man. Hope you are ok.
PurpleSweetz|You're not a deadbeat dad for having a disease - that's only running through your mind because of the stigma addiction holds.
Samuelbokay|Sometimes it's minute by minute. It's making each smart decision, one at a time. Family or pick up? Health or pick up? Personal integrity or... Good luck! You can do it.
SebbyHafen|My man, you're not going through this alone. You'll be ok. Make today better than yesterday, one step in front of the other. ❤️
atabadore1999|We’re always here if you need help or just want to vent. You can get through this I promise.
woods8189|Thank you. It will have to be tomorrow, I make better now coz this day already started for me lol
Katsie463|Thank you so much! I'm a week into it. We are doing the tapering method and to my surprise I've actually encountered some improvement at times. Obviously I am in no control of my medications and they are being administered to me. But it's actually been kind of working I think. But I am only a week into it...
SummerBreeze2008|What medications are they giving you? If you don’t mind me asking...
gogomom|You should go - just look up the next meeting and show up.  You don't have to talk, just listen - hell, you don't even have to give them your name.  You don't have to be clean and sober to show up to a meeting, but they ask that you don't share if that is the case.I went to lots of meetings while I was still using - it took a while for it all to sink in.Now clean and sober 8 years.
thecloudsoverhere|a life is a life, no matter what. being a burden to yourself does no good, and this will not change quickly. but, whatever your problem it can change you just need to let yourself be open to change. because honestly drugs aren't always the quickest death. they are just a damn fine way to cut yourself off from letting you truly experience all that life has to offer you. and sure a heroin addict may peak and feel like that is the best experience, but the first time i pushed my own boundaries, from the first time i ran 10km to the first time i felt like videotaping myself doing something (out of pride). i would say those trump and drug experience by miles. a good view i have learned is that we need to let ourselves be open to opportunities, because without those chances, we will never change. we will never know if the grass is greener on the other side, and if it's not then come back to your old way. but i think you will be pleasantly surprised to find out there is beauty all around you, you just have to have the open eyes and ears to see it. i went to AA at the start of my journey and it greatly helped me, i stayed for a short time and realized i needed something other than that, you may not. either way, cutting yourself off is like saying you are not worthy of experiencing all that life has to offer, and that is misguided. everyone should have a chance to change and better themselves, no matter if their mistakes were earlier today, or many years ago. go to the meeting, it may change your perspective on yourself and many other things as well. good luck and have faith in yourself, if nothing else. you deserve it.
Attachmentville|Fellowship is really important for recovery. Another major aspect is honesty. Good luck to you!
Modric-87|Yea Im a sex addict for sure. I only use drugs because it gets me excited for porn and webcamsites. At the beginning I did it too get more social and hook up with girls, porn totally took over my sex experience, girls wont do the job anymore for me. Im gonna visit a meeting again, hope I meet some nice people there.
LolSatan|Best way will be to not go out for a while.
Modric-87|You drink together with cocaine? Can you go without alcohol? Or did you without realising already became an alcoholic. Cocaine and alcohol form a totally new substance in your body: Coca-ethylene. Its much stronger then when you do the 2 substances seperately. Its much harder on your heart aswell. I cant drink anymore without having cocaine with me. So if I were you I would try to ban alcohol in your life and see how you react on that. I know there are people who can still drink now without getting the need to buy coke, because they took a break from all of it for a long time. I hope this is the case with you. Good luck! If you have any questions feel free too ask.
SebbyHafen|Yeah dude that's super rough :( what are your thoughts on switching jobs?
jajsur|Thanks I started doing things outside of work a lot more to keep me active its just when I get here it just so difficult to keep my mind off it.
2010_2010_2010AGAIN|Hello, thanks for posting. I can very much relate to the situation you find yourself in as I have had a weed/adderal problem for quite sometime.  Can I ask how old/how much time has gone by since you were a junior?
imoan-|Thank you for replying! 18 and a Senior in high school, I know it hasn’t been long sense this all started but the way things are progressing are really scaring me. I didn’t see any of this as a problem until very recently
BoobahMacaroni|I overdosed on a synthetic cannabinoid last weekend and almost died. I had to be taken to the hospital. I’m a poly substance drug addict and after that, I decided that I need to change or I’m going to die. I’m trying to get my usage down to just kratom alone but so far it’s been difficult.
SlixxyHonduran|No I’m actually being serious
thecloudsoverhere|i hope you feel better man, sounds like things are rough. take care and babble whenever you need to. sometimes, someone who responds is all you'll need. look inside yourself for the reasons to change, even if they are for other people. know how your actions make you feel about yourself and take steps to become the person you see yourself as in your dreams, eventually that will be the way you are
Hamburglarrrrr|Bribe yourself with positive reinforcement: After a week of no cigarettes I will buy those new shoes I’ve been wanting...a month new video game(s)? Keep it reasonable but worth the splurge. It’s an investment in you ;) My incentive was a one year goal (as I couldn’t remember going that long in 10+ years) and a expensive bike I always wanted
Modric-87|This, i have seen many people quitting sigs with the help of vaping. Worth a try.
NiczymPuma|Allens Carr easy way, read that book.You just need to learn about your addiction to cigarettes and win by logical thinking imo
PoetryfortheHunt|I found that exercising and getting my heart rate up (like going for a run) eliminated the urge altogether. That being said, it was only temporary, and seeing as most people can't run all day everyday this needs to be paired with a mixture of education (on the nature of addiction/ what to expect while quitting), replacing old bad habits with new good ones, and will power. Recovery is a process and it requires a lot of your attention to be successful (more so in the early days) so always look in the direction you want to go, looking in the rear view mirror will only lead you off the road. Good luck, stranger!
imoan-|Start vaping and lower the amount of nicotine with each bottle you buy until you hit 0, or just continue vaping if the health effects are less worrisome to you then the ones caused from smoking (I assume there’s still some negative health effects but don’t know enough to make a claim either way)...personally I got more addicted to nicotine switching to a vape but I wasn’t trying to quit I just didn’t want to be smoking cigs
jpchef|JUUL
whatwouldbuddhadrive|There were 4 things that helped me quit. 1. I asked my mom who had quit 10 years earlier if she still craved cigarettes and she said "No." I knew then that it would just be a waiting game. 2. My dad once made the comment that "...you have to want to be a non-smoker more than a smoker." That stuck with me.3. I stopped going to bars (this was years ago). But drinking in bars and smoking went hand-in-hand for me. I removed myself from that situation.4. Nicorette gum. That first night I was really going through withdrawal and started digging around in drawers. I popped a piece of that gum and ooohhhh yeah craving satisfied. I planned on fully transferring that addiction to nicorette and chew for the rest of my life. Of course, it tastes like shit, so I just eventually quit chewing it--I didn't have to try.
clockworkbuddha|Do they understand what addiction is? It’s not just a disease of poverty, can affect anyone. Implications of working with those with addiction- compassion and clear boundaries- awareness of own shit they bring to the table and where to take that.Importance of team working - God knows the solo flyers who think they know it all are dangerous as hell
catalinachalarka|I know I have to be in my SMART meeting this week. It's pulled me out of hell before and I will always love that community
darkcatwizard|You need to deal with your trauma properly before any real healing can begin to happen. Talk to a therapist you trust. This should be something that happens slowly and dealt with bit by bit. Wishing you the best!
hotcaulk|There are some CBD oils you can try that have no THC, so they will not get you high, but you may still have some relief. The little tobacco shop in my neighborhood that sells bowls and stuff sells that oil, too. You'd have to get a vape pen for it but most people know someone that has an extra one, anyways. You may wanna ask in r/aspergers or r/autism what they use as alternatives to cannabis. (I'm Autistic, that's where I get my info on this stuff. I use pot to manage PTSD/ASD. Quite a few of us on the Spectrum do. It comes up every once and again over there.) We use swings, too. Yes, like the ones you used in the park as a child. They can be very soothing. There are special ones for indoors, too. I like rocking chairs, too. Actually, just google Autism therapy tools/toys. We have a whole arsenal of stuff that may be able to get you through the next week. Those little *fine-tooth* brushes? You brush your arms with them. My SO's kept me out of a sensory melt down with one more than once. A weighted blanket is nice, too, when I get what I call "table flippy hands."
jd_l|There are some good medications for PTSD. I take clonodine, and it helps me tremendously. First you fix the mood, then you fix the behavior. Be strong and keep learning! All the best!
mrtrav50|I made my way into recovery a little over 9 years ago and dont jnow where i would be without all the love i get from my recovery community. Having people around that understand the pain of using and not using is essential.
pimptywin|Are there any health services in your city where you can go to a group or get counseling?
sh0nuff|Hitting up a meeting every day is essential behavior in this stage. Sometimes multiple meetings. If there isn't a SMART available, go to an NA or AA. You don't need to identify what you're there for, you just need the community and a safe place to vent if that's what gets you through. I am a Buddhist, and I got through my first 3 years at NA meetings. I just identified my higher power as an internal locus that I had to tap into through meditation.. I never felt any religious pressure.. Additionally, finding a sponsor, (even if they aren't your official one that's belong you with step work or whatever) that you can text, call, etc... And socializing with the groups.. Usually there's coffee time or pancakes or whatever before / after each meeting...Basically you need to live and breathe recovery 24/7 when you're not sleeping. Avoid any old friends who still use, delete all the numbers for toxicity, no more dealers in your phone etc.You know you can do this. Just lean on us until you can stand on your own. It's ok. We've all been there.
urgent45|OK I remember this very well. For me it was Day 2 and I felt like I was going insane. My brain was literally demanding that I get in the car and drive to get my captain morgan.. then call my dealer. But no, I wasn't having any of that BS from my stupid brain. So, in desperation, I picked up the book, you know, the Blue Book, and started to read. It was nice to hear from others who went through these horrible addictions. Then I looked at the steps. One was easy. Two, not so much but I could get there. Three - OK, here's where I lose people (if I haven't lost you already). I prayed. I got on my knees and prayed. In that prayer I surrendered. I said God, I cannot do this. Please take this burden. I cannot handle it. In those dark moments, I felt a warmth, a quiet strength came to me. Something I can only describe as serenity filled me. I knew I could make it through the night.Please don't write me off as a Jesus freak or religious nut. I am not. I am agnostic. I don't even pray or go to church anymore. But that night and every night I prayed that week, I felt that serenity. I cannot explain the experience apart from what I just told you. It got me through. I also went to meetings... but after a year of them I switched to a masters program instead to keep me busy. (oh yeah, I had mountains of energy when I got sober)Most people say go to meetings. Yes, I agree. I went through 11 days and sleepless nights of withdrawals. Muscles aches, anxiety, sleeplessness. .. ugh. But for me, I could not have made it through those first weeks without steps 1 to 3. Ironically, I could not conquer addiction, but through surrender I was able to reach sobriety and stay there. I wish you luck. It's no big deal, just your life, your happiness. Right?
ccesi69|I'm really sorry for you all.I've got an addiction to painkillers too managed to quit many times.Which obviously means that sooner or later I failed every time.That said, the weeks/months when I feel worst is when I use a lot AND when I force myself to be clean.The good times come when I use low dosage. And it took a while but now my friends/family agree that they should't force me to be clean (usually trying to make me feel guilty) but tactfully checking that I'm not using too much and being supportive.I don't know if this apply to your mom but the point for me is moderation and (self)acceptance.
thecloudsoverhere|maybe you could tell her how it makes you feel? not necessarily in a meaning scolding fashion, but in a "i can see this is causing problems and i want this to change kinda way". being an addict myself i can say that pain from family members can just cause the person to delve deeper into the problem, since that may be their only source of freedom currently. what may help with the problem is understanding that drugs fill a void in people. and stopping them without filling that void does no benefit for the addict, it just stresses them the fuck out and causes them to become more recluse. which you have seen. i thankfully, personally had many experiences throughout my recovery which allowed me to see that i could fill those voids myself, but until then, she may need a reason to stop. but consistently hammering home that she needs to quit for you can make her see you as selfish, just as you may see her habits that way. painkillers especially provide a release from daily stress and being forced to quite may have become one of those serious stresses. for me personally i just needed someone to show they really cared, not that they would pay for rehab or give me other alternatives, but that i would always have a person to bring me up and remind me of the best me i could be. a sponsor of sorts. it may sound weird, but if she is taking the drugs at night, maybe consider asking her to watch a movie with her at night, or just talk with her when you think she is normally using and make the conversation bright and engaging. even if it's the whole goddamn night. sleep returns. sometimes people don't. and both of the other comments are right. rock bottom or acceptance may work, so try those if need be, but also know that you can be her saving grace until she is that for herself. invest your time into things that can help and subtly apply those through your actions (silent work is the most respected kind when it is finally noticed). most of all, do not give up! believe in yourself as well as her. drugs are just a bad choice, but people can change. they just may need to see that they are strong enough to do so, they need to see that the ones they love are strong enough to change with them. change your mind to see the person you want her to be, as well as the person you want to be, both for yourself and her. the past is in the past. let her move on from her shitty mistakes, no matter how hard, but talk about it eventually. otherwise resentment may form. be the beautiful sign of hope that you want to be, and the rest will fall into place. Good Luck. Time will heal this if you let it.
urgent45|Sober 18 years here. This is such a difficult problem. It seems that many/most addicts will not get serious until they truly suffer. Often that includes losing their job/career, their home, and their loved ones. Sometimes that doesn't even work. Sometimes, the addict will find a "savior" to live with and pay their bills. As for rehab, it can work if that person is ready. Ready is a big word here and usually comes only after the addict suffers severely from the lifestyle. If someone is, as I say, really ready, then rehab is not necessary. They can get sober just by going to meetings and working a program...like me. I am living proof that AA works. I am so so sorry that you are going through this. But sheltering and shielding someone from the natural consequences of addictive behavior only serves to prolong things.
Idekaname|I just have one friend I talk to on a daily basis. I do have some other friends but I'm not in contact with them right now. I don't care about being popular, but just want some basic acknowledgement and respect by peers which I'm sure everyone else does too. What are codependent issues?
Monstiemama|I definitely think it's normal. People "fantasize" about all kinds of things: having someone to comfort them, being beautiful, being rich, etc... It's absolutely 100% normal and it's also probably your brain's way of soothing you. What's the point of life if there's nothing to look forward to?
PurpleSweetz|Oh sorry I misread your OP. I thought you said you had a boyfriend and have all these feelings and fantasizes about him. Forget the codependent stuff (although given your situation, I wouldn't be surprised if codependency does occur). Codependency means you rely on someone else to make you feel happy or you simply "need" this other person.
SummerBreeze2008|The best part about being a teenager is daydreaming about boys! :) well it was for me anyway.
ccesi69|It's a gift because the lack of romanticism is a much bigger problem, as I learned on /r/asexualitypls don't read it now if you feel really vulnerable
willyspringz|How are you handling your severe depression? Do you take medication? If you are medicated, have you found these lonely thoughts (my interpretation) are more frequent with or without meds?
PoetryfortheHunt|That sounds to me like some of the symptoms of ADHD. Have you talked to a doctor about it? Do you have a prescription for it? Have you been diagnosed with ADHD?
PurpleSweetz|Yeah you're abusing it to have more fun (or maybe fun in general). Sounds like how I started out. I did the same thing: adderall for school work and then I started using it to socialize more, play video games and just drive and blast music. Years down the line and I'm a recovering addict in NA. I'd seek help - maybe talk to your psych/therapist? If you can't stop, you have a problem - and it's a serious problem you'd want to nip in the butt before your life gets destroyed.
Warrior5108|Honestly id recommend a 12 step program like AA. I know this is a classic kind of answer thing. But its the only thing that has given me hope in a long time
Zachalbrecht1|i can’t stay focused on one task and i get flustered. also it makes me more social and my anxiety it completely gone. i can’t usually talk to customers/coworkers like i can when i’m on addy
PurpleSweetz|Dependence is not necessarily "addiction". Any drug that requires you to ween off is based upon dependence as your brain/body adjusts to having it. But addiction is more the mental obsession with wanting more and more of whatever it may be.
SOmuch2learn|This is addiction. I am prescribed Lyrica and can tell you I went through hell when I once forget to get it refilled.  Be honest with a doctor so you can withdraw safely and more comfortably.
atabadore1999|Yes, it’s your body’s reaction to no longer getting a substance it’s dependent on having. You’re experiencing withdrawal and it can be quite uncomfortable. Do you smoke weed? I would imagine it could help with withdrawal a decent amount.
mynameisjohnmerrick|I'm prescribed it and even cutting down from 200mg to 100mg has given me upset stomach, panic attacks and suicidal depression.I've previously kicked heroin cold turkey a few times so I've some experience of withdrawal.You will need to taper to get off it.What kind of doses are you taking?
thecloudsoverhere|my personal method of dealing with addiction is finding out the receptor that the drug interacts with and finding a lesser for of it. i.e when coming off of oxy i used black cumin seed to fight the terrible side effects which honestly were mostly mental (had a long taper time and started a lot of new hobbies to fill my time/ waste my energy). other than a small boost in supplements you can seriously help by investing your time in improving other aspects of your life. look to the reasons why you were taking it in the first place. for me I broke my back which gave me problems when i wasn't active or seeking out the best foods/ vitamins for myself. smoking weed or other substances are a great idea, but only if you honestly have the willpower to stop those as well before building a dependency (weed dependency ohh scary, well honestly it can be if it skews your perspective to the point where you are too mentally blind to see all of the shit you are missing) Valerian (personally makes me an asshole) or green tea preferably are good choices throughout the day (for gaba) and if you have trouble sleeping weed can be great as a night cap. addiction or not it doesn't matter. the important thing is to realize that your body craves it. now you have the responsibility to change that, and i mean actively work your ass off at it, or suffer through the withdrawal. i took the perspective that i needed to change this train of thought (that i needed something) because to be honest i saw a pattern that hadn't started with pills, and i bet you can find escaping patterns within your own life other than lyrica. for me personally it was as simple (not to sound so damn condescending) as running at the peak of my shitty feelings, that way whenever i felt like ass on the days that followed i remembered that run and that i had dragged my ass out there. that no one but yourself can change the circumstances that led you to where you are. recently i started to control everything down to the amount of caffeine i am consuming. this feeling of the ability to control these things has led me to be able to stop small things at the flip of a switch. the same will come for you, time will not go any faster and avoidance is just that. research the best way to stop and follow whatever you decide to a T. otherwise you will in all likely-hood become plagued with withdrawal thoughts. physical symptoms are a whole other animal though. those again need to be researched and followed, again in a way you deem fit. if you think i'm stupid or just have a question feel free to respond, i'll reply to the latter. good luck and get to researching, only you can save your ass friend. and find something to be proud of other than getting off drugs, this way you can have feelings of pride without letting everyone know you are getting off of them. cheers. -Poly-addict
dtw350z|It can be a real problem sometimes.
Lvrry|It’s alright.  Better than days 2 and 3, but still mentally exhausted and restless.Just took a bunch of diphenhydramine, thinking about downing the rest of the bottle and locking my bedroom door
Morgennes|Of course it's not easy - otherwise it wouldn't be an addiction
PhamousFilosopher|Okay,  a big problem with the way many people view addictions is that you “just need to stop.” Now even if you are able to accomplish that you aren’t attacking the actual problem and will inevitably end up replacing your old addiction with a new one. Instead of trying to stop what you’re doing, fill your time with other things. Now I know this is easier said than done, I’m a recovering drug addict with 19 months and I’m currently dealing with screen addiction as well but the most effective solution so far has been making new friends and finding new hobbies.
person2457|I think I just need to get out more. I took a long walk yesterday and didn't even look.
vladthedracul|No you won't. Quit making excuses. Fix your damn problems, but if all you wanna do is complain about them like a teenager throwing a fit, I don't know what to tell you.
beerwithastravv|That’s amazing! Throwing them out definitely shows commitment. You have a place to go for support now, you can do this!!!!
brokenhalfjap|Awesome! Keep up the good work!
frostmechanic1|Thanks homie. Coming up on 3 weeks this Saturday!
gucciclit|That’s amazing man! Keep it up!
HazedAndEschewed|I wouldn't worry about caffeine being fatal by itself.  It is an easy way to get yourself dehydrated and you should be very careful about not exercising while caffeinated as that can put stress on your heart.  You're young enough that coffee alone likely doesn't pose a risk.I use caffeine pills sometimes, and those are 200 mg and are safe to take once every four hours.  A normal cup of coffee is 80 mg if that helps you gauge your usage at all.Cut back if you feel it is an issue, though.  Feeling safe is the most important thing, not to mention that caffeine can build up a tolerance and cause anxiety.
AMYEMZ|Well, it just plain stinks.  Take care.
Afuckindragonyo|This really hits home. I am so sorry this happened. I can’t even imagine being his gf or his mom.
HandoTrius|So sorry To Hear This. May he rest in piece and to those of us still in pain may we remain hopeful.
Middleman86|Yeah. It hurts. Thank you.
SOmuch2learn|So Sad. Heartbreaking. I'm sorry. [You're a good writer.]
eFrazes|I’m glad you shared. Sorry for your loss.
gogomom|I am sorry this happened to you.  I have had several people die that I went to rehab with and that had kept in touch.The first one who died, in her last conversation with me, had said "I am a medical professional, even if I relapse, I won't die".  I felt a lot of guilt about that, like I could have done something to prevent it.   That guilt lead to a relapse, and another 2 years of using.  Just something to look out for.
standsure|ah, crap. [wordless hug]
AMYEMZ|this is horrible, from what I understand as long as the person is legal age, there is not a lot you can do.  Try arranging an intervention? (research a good interventionist & therapist)...
Modric-87|He refuses help, then it becomes a matter of waiting till he reach his rock bottom and is done with his lifestyle, lets hope that moment comes in time. Take care.
SOmuch2learn|Call the cops when he is driving under the influence.
beerwithastravv|I’m assuming these aren’t prescribed to him? It’s hard, but an ultimatum really can work. The intervention is a good idea. Along with calling the cops when he’s driving like that. Also, if you know he has pills on him. I would also call.
lucky-cane_user|We and his employer convinced him to go to rehab. Got him checked in today. Hopefully he stays.
SOmuch2learn|Alleluia!
beerwithastravv|Oh my god!! That’s amazing! I’m so happy for you and your family. I’m sure it must have been a big wake up call when she realized how out out of it she was. Her sense of time and not knowing you took her to her appointments is crazy! Awesome your sis works there
eyegotquestions|Hey! Thank you so much for the supporting comment. It really helped! And it's okay, lol. I do that all the time. We actually talked to her last night. She thought she had only been on the Xanax for 2 weeks... when it's been months. We told her she was supposed to be weaning off like the doctor said and she was replied with, "How are you guys supposed to know?! It's not like you go with me!" We were just like, "Holy shit." Because we go to all of her appointments. She listened to use all night and is actually checking into a rehab center where my sister works today! My Mom and Dad are taking her right at this moment! I have had so many happy tears today!!!
DankyMcBud|Fair enough point but definetly not as easy as it sounds when there's physical dependencies and months of withdraw symptoms. Granted some are minor others are more serious. For me personally, they include complete loss of appetite, chronic insomnia, intense mood swings, intense paranoia. There's probably more going on mentally than the addiction contributing to that but that's probably why I started self medicating in the first place. I didn't expect the post to get any response at all so I didn't go into much detail; but I tried the quit instantly method. It works in the sense I can pull away from everything for maybe a month or two, but any addict would know that caving is very easy to do when you quit cold turkey because you can just tell yourself you can pull away from it if it "gets bad." They it ramps up again and boom your back to where it began. The last stretch I tried cold turkey, I sought out medical help and the psychotropic drugs were too much, to say the least. They tried so many over the course of a year I'd say and I finally broke from that but instantly went back to using, which was my worst bender of using ecstacy 3-4 times a week, sometimes for days straight. I didn't include that one in my post because I recently broke that addiction. Once it is a clear issue and caused plenty of destruction, it's a lot easier move away from it. That's how I overcame pill addictions too, it just became so damaging I had to move away or I honestly would have died. But the confusion in "when does it become a problem" isn't "oh noes am I bad boi" it's more where is the line drawn for these lesser addictions. It's like I don't feel comfortable even reaching out to professionals because it's so petty compared to help I've received before, but it's an addiction nonetheless that is putting me in situations I feel are morally wrong.
PurpleSweetz|That's you. It isn't so simple for 99.99% of other people.
SOmuch2learn|There is help if you want it. Doctors. Counselors. Rehab. Support groups.
SigNinja|Okay, fine. Can someone explain to me why the title of the post is "When does it become a problem?" What I hear from this guy is that he's smoking pot and drinking too much but not in a way that society would necessarily condemn. He's trying to figure out whether or not his over-indulgence might be addiction.What I'm trying to say is JUST STOP FUCKING DRINKING AND SMOKING POT.Not, hmm, is this an addiction? Hmm, is this bad? Hmm, am I being a bad boy? Just stop the mental masturbation and quite already for fuck's sake.
blue_7|same problems man... no answers
domin262|Reach out to resources and support groups for drug and alcohol addiction nearby! Attend a few until you find one you like and see how you feel. If you want to take it another step forward try meeting with a therapist that specializes in chemical dependency. Even if your use seems mild, it’s better to treat it now rather than later.   Best of luck!
Ibvulpine12345|Get involved with bad people and risk my freedom/ everything for money and access.... darknet. Lucky as fuck to have gotten popped after I was long done with that otherwise I’d still probably be paying the price.
PathologicalCider|would say I'm more of a bad person than an addict but stole meds from a incredibly sweet lady with terminal cancer
Pm_MeyourManBoobs|I lied to them about my adderall use. I abuse drugs and don't know how to use my rx responsibly. I have a month cyclical addiction where I am addicted to using as well as addicted to the withdrawal. Its been 14 days now and I feel like I am going to use again, regrettably. They know about my use.  Addiction sucks.
swingsandwhatnot|Yes it's the worst and sucks badly.
123456dy|Addiction is not rational which is so hard to understand at times. I am aware of the consequences, the feelings after, the waste of money, etc., yet you can or yet always will still justify doing it.
Bigperm43|Loneliness definitely is a staple in addiction for me. It thrives on me being alone so I will listen more and more to it.
Modric-87|Isolation is what addiction needs.
NotAnAlligator|Loneliness is certainly a large portion of it (Even though I have some friends and a SO, it doesn't mean I'm not lonely). More-so, for me, it's the fear of failure. I feel like I've already failed and can't turned back the hands of time, so I use ... it takes me to a place of apathy and dullness, but - at least for now, I would rather dull myself than feel life. It's sad to write this out as I'm very much aware of my issues, but I don't want to stop and I really don't know how to change that mindset.Take right now for example. I just blew through 30 30mg oxys and 60 15mg oxys ... that was in about 5 days with one other user. I'm on day 3 of w/ds, which are a walk in the park at this point, but I know that I won't get to this juncture another 100 times. One of my using spells will kill me.Good luck (Try!)!
SebbyHafen|Haha yeah it definitely does for me :) addiction becomes an emotional crutch as much as a physical
clockworkbuddha|I am indeed in uk
littlelunacy|Nope. Not at ALL easy. It bums me out.
swingsandwhatnot|It's called Substance to solution it's in the UK. Are you from the uk? I rang them before and they said just come in it's a walk in appointment at first.
vegasgal|For me, yes. Drug of choice, gambling, food, all consumed to fill the emptiness-the void inside. Get a couple of dogs-they'll always want to be w you-especially when you're on the toilet, but that's the price you pay for constant love and the connection you get when you FEEL/PET a fuzzy animal. Of course, dogs don't make all the loneliness go away, but they DO help. Additionally, I have more than a little germophobia-I force myself to pet and kiss the dogs-EVEN THO THEY LIE ON THE DIRTY CARPET, WALK AROUND THE BLOCK, ETC. My need to fill the void inside is greater than my germophobia. I make myself touch and love on the dogs as a way to keep the germophobia in check.
djohn50|I appreciate all of the advice and encouragement.  I'm ready to do this.
luckycatsweaters|Nobody’s going to make you do anything. NA meetings are full of people who can relate to exactly what you’re going through, and I promise you they are the least judgmental people you will ever meet in your life. The only requirement for membership is a *desire* to stay clean. They will guide you through the easiest course possible with overcoming your addictions.  Just give it a shot!
senstat40|It is hard to get in the door that first time. It’s an acknowledgement of accountability, which by itself is scary, but also a huge surrender to a room of strangers, which is especially frightening if you have panic disorder. I’ve had PD for 20 yrs., which played a big role in my drinking, and even after I’d gotten into AA it took me several meetings before I was ready to open up. And that’s ok, it is in fact not even that unusual. Once you’re there people, others also recovering, who also were probably scared to walk through the door once, will make themselves known to you. After that it’s largely about willingness. And I know it’s easier said than done, but it is doable, and I believe you can do it.
topofthecentipede|I have panic disorder and used to loooove my klonopin. I relied on it heavily, but especially coming off the booze. I've been sober 8 months and I think gabapentin has done the trick. I've been a waiter in recovery and just got a job as a sales exec. Gabapentin seems to work for me.
ODonTHC|I had a similar problem when I was 17 with Klonopin, granted not very severe. I think you should tell your psychiatrist that the Klonopin you're on is making you feel addicted, and he/she will know other medicine that may be more effective and less prone to addiction.
PhamousFilosopher|Others have already given the good advice to mention it to your doctor and parents so I’ll just say that you have nothing to apologize for. We’ve all been there, you’ve done some bad shit and you think you’re a bad person but it’s just not the case. You have a disorder (possibly) and like any other it’s not completely under your control. You just need I take steps to fix the problem and you’re already doing that.
beerwithastravv|To the best of my knowledge, no benzo is also a narcotic. Unless there’s some medication out there I haven’t heard of. But any anxiety medication that’s prescribed isn’t a narcotic (Xanax, klonopin, Ativan, and Valium aren’t narcotics)
boldfaceprint|Kind of an edit but.  You seem smart. You’re on Reddit.  Ha, so at least your that smart!  You have your life to catch on all that. For now focus on your doctors visit. Sorry communicating to you so much. I see a mirror of myself. I was a bright young kid one.  And I’m still pretty well red considering most of the lethargic folks walking around oblivious to everything, and how it all works. Anyways I’ll leave you alone. Thanks for the reply.
havnter666|Hey, I was heavily addicted to klonopin when I was 18 and I really can't remember a portion of 2016 because of it. It started with just upping my intake because I wanted to deal with my depression, but it spiraled out of control. Please tell someone and get help. Its a nasty, dangerous addiction that a lot of people don't like talking about. Your parents and your doctor won't lose trust in you, but it's important that you tell them that you're worried that you might become dependant on it. I wish you all the best xx
idkmyname__77|Recognizing that you may have an issue and speaking to your doc and parents will show them how mature and self aware you are. They will help to put you on the right track before it’s out of control
jagste|Well I’m mostly using the KPin to sleep and so I don’t feel as depressed or anxious the following day, but until I find an anti depressant that works, I think I’ll talk to her about a safer alternatives. She does prescribe leniently.
michael-satterfield|I would definitely consult with the prescribing doctor. There are non-narcotic alternatives for anxiety and depression.
Drumma516|We love hiking so that’s on my list
beerwithastravv|I think it’ll be nice for the two of you to spend that day alone together. The person that matters most is the one that supported her and got her through it! Three years is amazing!!! One thing I would do is write a letter. You can tell her all the things you want her to know, how proud you are of her, how strong she is, etc.   She’ll have those words in tangible form, something she can look back on in times of need or just to reflect. I also think a cake is in order.  Maybe one decorated like her new chip!
swanbearpig|Go for a hike. It's fun and could be symbolic in this case, too.
PhamousFilosopher|Well I want to start by saying that it’s almost definitely not a coincidence he keeps attracting this kind of woman, from his secretive behavior you’ve mentioned it doesn’t seem like too much of a stretch that he may have some addiction problems of his own. Something you need to understand is that you don’t own this guy anything, as a friend it is not your job to fix his personal life and it will only end in misery for you. I recently had to cut off my best friend of 14 years because he was getting into cocaine. I recommended help, told him that it wasn’t a good idea, and that if he continues down this path I can’t be around him. It’s really hard but you need to surround yourself with healthy and supportive people who make good decisions. This isn’t what TV and Movies will tell you, they’ll say to stand by because eventually you’ll be able to fix the problem but that’s just not how real life works.
SaraMilano|I appreciate your advice. I must say that I have not felt overwhelmed by my friend's relationship troubles so perhaps I was successful at not getting too involved with the drama myself. Nonetheless, I get your point. Nobody has really confronted John about his "patterns" as of yet...maybe that is what needs to change? I am not sure what John's "problem" really is. That I know of, I do not think he's abusing any substances...but he does seem "addicted" to seriously dysfunctional relationships. I just wonder if I should bring it up to his attention. Also, I'm really sorry about your friend. I can imagine it must have been terribly difficult to end a 14-year long friendship. It takes courage do to. I hope he does better.
ThrowAwaySympathizer|Thanks, maybe I could send that to them for a read -- they are open minded generally, that's why it confuses me why they're so stubborn on this issue
beerwithastravv|You should speak with HR.  They should form some sort of meeting to educate your idiot college. To inform them of the psychological affect of gambling ( relating to how neurotransmitters reuptake, it’s function, etc).
michael-satterfield|Yeah, I think really what it boils down to is people that don't deal with addiction have a hard time understanding, how or why it's so difficult for us to stop. Plus there's so much stigma attached to addicts and we're demonized in numerous films, and through the media. It's tough for people to get past those preconceived notions that in recovery many of us do amazing and wonderful things. We often become the beacons of light and compassion in our communities, so long as we hold on, and keep working some kind of program
Hanoverview|Why ?  it forces him to stop using and maybe he can get some help . after all i am in germany not the US .  put lets say i dont  what do i do ?
Modric-87|He gotta want to quit for himself, if he doesnt want that not a 1000 cops or an army is gonna save him. Just keep in contact with him and try to plan some nice things together outside the house. Show him life can be fun without constantly smoking weed. Good luck.
xamcali|Don’t call the cops on him
Lvrry|Shonuff! Is this a blood sport reference? If so, 50 xp to you.  Power up!
Nefelib|Well Jesus man, stop smoking crack with him.  Be an example if you want, inspire and support him to quit.  Google smart recovery and look for some meeting online or in your area.  If he's addicted to anything there isn't much else you can do other than not enable.
SOmuch2learn|Yes, he is addicted.  Stop doing drugs with him! Don't hang out with him. You can't help him, but you can help yourself.
sh0nuff|It's a Shogun of Harlem reference.. Even better than Bloodsport. :0
2010_2010_2010AGAIN|yeah ops a real fucknut and is probably even addicted to drugs lmao
ODonTHC|What are you talking about addiction is a serious problem and making blanket statements like that spread the stigma that prevent addicts from getting real help. Addiction is NOT taking a whole bottle of pills to die.
OGpizza|Trust me, everyone here wants to use less/quit outright. They share your opinion that people shouldn’t be abusing drugs. That’s what this group is for, seeking help and encouragement to get past the addiction. No one is glorifying addiction nor drug use here, so your frustration is completely misdirected
Sorella126|One of the things I do at my job is process death claims. The number of death claims from accidental overdosed of prescription meds has gone up by I would say 15% or more in the last three years. I just had one where a 30 year old woman was taking medicine for PCOS and meds for depression that cause fatal drug toxicity. It was ruled accidental due to the fact that it appears the levels in her system weren’t above the ones prescribed. OP is a troll that doesn’t know what they are taking about imo
dahdoc|Maybe I'm wrong, and I hope I'm wrong, but this seems more like an indirect finger pointing, bitch against addicts than anything.
gogomom|"Responsible prescription medication use" is not the issue - it's when people take prescription drugs irresponsibly - and most addicts know when they cross that line, when they are taking more of thier prescription than recommended or when they are using thier medication for it's mood altering side effects instead of it's intended purpose.This addiction crises (IMO) seems to be more about Fentanyl, a drug that can cause overdose in very small amounts, and has nothing what.so.ever. to do with people taking half a bottle of anything.
Morgennes|Me too.Why am I even writing this? I should be sleeping now.Good night.
michael-satterfield|You unfortunately can't force people into rehab, (well in some instances this is possible) but you can be supportive. This is the guide I wrote on the subject. https://sobanewjersey.com/guide-families-addicts-alcoholics-2/Let me know if it's at all helpful.
DrRecovery|The best and most honest advice I can give you is to look for the nearest AA group and join other people just like you. You'll be surprised of how many, like yourself, struggle with similar issues.AA Big BookForward to Fourth Edition p.XXIVIn any meeting, anywhere, AA's share experience, strength and hope with each other, in order to stay sober and help others. [...] AA's speak the language if the heart in all its power and simplicity.Chapter 2. There is a solution p. 17We are people who normally would not mixChapter 2. There is a solution p.17We have discovered a common solutionChapter 2. There is a solution p.25If we had passed into the region from which there is no return through human aid, we had but two alternatives: One was to go on to the bitter end, blotting out the consciousness of our intolerable situation as best as we could; and the other, to accept spiritual help.
Ringoateyourbaby|Trying to deal with this on your own will probably never work. Support from others in your same situation will be the most beneficial. Treatment might seem embarrassing or unnecessary but I guarantee it will help you. Or, at the very least find a meeting^. Find people you can talk to. Don’t try to fight it by yourself. Dont be afraid to ask for help! There are plenty of resources out their. Hang in there!
vegasgal|I've spent thousands of hours in 12 step programs. This year was really bad for me and I went to a psychiatrist. I went for help to reduce my rage issues, but I believe what he prescribed can (maybe) help you.He prescribed a drug that reduces impulses; changes the way you react to the impulse to (fill in the blank). Name of med is Lamactil, generic is Lamotrigine. There is a subreddit for Lamactil, too. When I searched for the Lamactil sub, I discovered the drug's name is many subs. Here is one.https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/23ktdr/on_lamactil_for_4_weeks_very_stable_i_have_lost/
GunnerMcGrath|Masturbation, porn, video games, and tv are all actually SUPER common addictions, even the way you are jumping from one to another. You're absolutely not unusual in that regard. Doesn't make them any more damaging to your mental health and relationships, but I just wanted to say that first.The thing about addictions, and especially behavioral ones, is that they are a coping mechanism for dealing with your pain, stress, and boredom. You likely don't currently know why you have to numb and escape so much but you've taught yourself an unhealthy way to deal with them. I'd talk to your school counselor. The addictions are just a symptom of other issues. It may take time to figure out what is causing them.The great news is that you've identified a problem relatively quickly. Many people take decades to get where you are and it takes them many years to really change. It will still be difficult but hopefully not something that affects you strongly for the rest of your life. Don't wait though. Addictions never get better on their own.
Schnitzel8|I don’t think it matters that you’re dominating school and extracurriculars. The question is do you want your activities to be consciously decided by yourself or do want to just do things compulsively? If you go according to your psychological and biological conditioning then you are just being compulsive. So how to overcome your late night compulsiveness? Cardio. Lots of cardio. If you’re exhausted you’ll just hit the bed and crash and not even consider watching porn or playing video games. Meditation will also help you identify thought patterns which lead to compulsive behavior.
karma_withdrawal|I don't know how much you weigh, how old you are, but I've seen as much as 10mg of Melatonin prescribed to an adolescent. Ever tried a half or whole dose of Benadryl? Also over the counter and a pretty effective sedative... And it will clear up your sinuses!Seriously, it sounds like you have trouble winding down in the evening. Have you tried going to bed earlier in increments? Like if you go to bed at midnight, try 11 or 11:30 the next night.Have you tried any meditation or measured breathing? I like to count backwards from 100 with measured breathing to help relax me to sleep, I just start at 100 again and repeat until sleep. Is there any trauma or anything causing you anxiety that you are avoiding? Talk to someone safe about it. PM me if you have any questions or need anything. Good luck!
sandoadonis|another thing you can do is just turn off all the screens, read a book and let your melatonin kick in. light destroys melatonin! it has worked wonders for me. i used to stay up on my phone, but now as soon as i go into my room i plug my phone in and lay down and i am asleep much more quickly.
standsure|Addiction is all about dopamine, all 'drugs' are tied to that chemical. An addict can't logic or reason their way out of addictive behaviour. You could check out r/pornfree for  help with masturbation.  It's (mostly male) folks who want to stop. I found it helpful to chat with folks on the same page though I've never really been into porn.
vegasgal|What you said! I agree! I turn off the TV, tablet pretty early. I use an old phone to listen to library audiobooks. Most of the time, I can fall asleep listening. The problem arises when I get caught up in the book and have to listen till it ends; about 8+ hrs. Pick a book in a genre you like but don't love. Even though the broadcast is running, the screen goes to sleep. No blue light to keep you awake.
OGpizza|Are you currently using or in withdrawal? From what substances?Try sugar water, or sugary tea with milk. Will provide nourishment until you can get something solid in. Saltine crackers are great too, eat and drink slowly and space it out
sh0nuff|Check out the [BRAT diet](https://www.healthline.com/health/brat-diet), and the associated similar foodsMake sure to drink lots of water and dissolve electrolytes in it.. Even if you bring it up it will give you some benefit while you can keep it down
PoetryfortheHunt|Remember the days the sun was bright?Remember the warmth of it's shining light?Remember you are worth the fightand that you aren't alone tonight
foondoo|This is absolutely so amazing and 100% true ❤️
Lvrry|How did that feel showing up not welcomed only to find out her family was there as well? Lucky she didn’t call the cops on your belligerent ass
Mind0Matter|Thank you it means a lot
OGpizza|Pick yourself up and move forward; be stronger than the person you were when you made those mistakes. You’ve been sober and better in the past before so it’s not impossible to be that version of yourself again. Avoid the version of yourself that got mixed up in all this. Work on yourself, become better, and the loneliness and sadness will disappear with time.
PurpleSweetz|Man fuck that shit. Someday you'll be out spending all that money while she's sitting around wondering why she didn't come up from nothing. You'll make it from this bottom and when she sees you, you'll be stuntin'. All of your cars will start with the push of a button. People will tell you you've changed since you blew up, or whatever you call it - hell, you'll have switched the number to your phone so SHE never could call it. And no need for a name on your shirt, they'll be able to tell that you're ballin'!! SWISH. It'll be a shame for her, cuz she could've got picked. Had a really good game, but she'll have mentioned who she will been with at the top, or what she COULDVE had - but sad to say, it's over for her!!! Man, get that Rolls Royce Phantom with a valet open doors. She said "go away", well she got what she was looking for. Too late for her then. Better yourself bro.
nodisintegrations420|How much/often you doing the xanax? Mixing the 2 is a terrible combo btw just asking for a blackout.. Unfortunately i do have plenty experience with the combination
MayoisanInstrument1|Sounds like it could just be fron anxiety, it's crazy the things it can do to you.
SOmuch2learn|Check out /r/OpiatesRecovery.
cvanagas|Anxiety is definitely a symptom, which can make it hard to breathe. Also, I’ve noticed that, when my jaw gets really tight (another symptom of withdrawal) I can get really sharp chest pain, that kind of feels like severe heartburn. I can usually reduce it by stretching my jaw, by putting my fist underneath it, and pushing my jaw into my fist, creating an isometric stretch. If it persists, though, definitely see a doctor.
vladthedracul|Pls go to a doctor, internet doesn't have the answers.
Slimcivic|Keep it up man. That stuffs the devil. I bet u feel so gross and clamy and zombielike
bigpapi69x|Great work:)
SOmuch2learn|Benzo withdrawal should be managed by a doctor. It can be dangerous. You can have seizures or worse. It also takes a long time. Get medical help.
e1879|Also btw the cannabis wouldn’t be used while I’m working as need to stay alert but I have Canabidol brand raw extract full spectrum CBD oil and Canibadol  brand vape juice and an e cigarette if I needed it to hit fast as back up
Cdean20|Reach out for help if you need it. If your mind is ever racing and you need someone to talk to feel free to PM me. Take care of yourself!
Danette3795|Thank again so much I will prob take you up on that offer
Slimcivic|Was addicted to adderall and then meth before I switched over to IV heroin. It took me soooooo long to feel normal coming off addy. Never had energy and had no drive to do anything besides sleep. It comes back with time. Unfortunately I stopped waiting and started a 6 year opiate and heroin habit. I’m currently 18 months clean and have never felt better in my life.
dchristiaens|Relapse is part of the process so don't beat yourself up too much. More importantly you recognized you've fucked up and are ready to try again
frostmechanic1|Don't take it out on yourself! Easier said than done I know but it happens. The only thing you can do now is learn from it. I've had some relapses over the years and they all tend to follow a pattern (isolation for me personally).  Figuring out what leads you back will give you the tools to stop the cycle.
ABurlyKeel|Can you find some sort of a support group?
thatguyakira123|I dunno where to look locally tbh
