{"t3_7wv7yv": [{"0_title": "Anyone care to hear about the German dope game?", "1_text": "Posted this on my old accout in 2016, it still applies though. Except with the refugee influx, we have a bunch of North africans/Syrians peddling bunk dope. Absolutely wouldn't recommend picking up from them folk, get your dope from Russians or Iranians like any kraut junkie worth his salt.\n\\n\\nGermany has a pretty interesting dope scene, you wouldn't expect us to, but it's vibrant. Open air markets are pretty rare, save for major cities (by German standards, so at least 500k people). To make up for that we have other Junkie meet-up spots, like using kit vending machines, Methadone/Heroin clinics, or fixing rooms. Just shoot the shit with the locals, offer to toss them a bag or two, walk to the spot with them, and of course, DON'T LET YOUR MONEY WALK (some things are universal it seems). Get a number and there's your connect. The dope is always brown pretty much, it comes in from the ports of Amsterdam and Northwest Germany, at least that's my theory since the quality of dope is proportional to your distance from the Netherlands. Your gear comes wrapped in multiple sheets of plastic, my connect usually kept it in a fanny pak, which I thought was hilarious seeing him seemingly reaching into his crotch to pull out my product. You call the guy, he tells you where he's at, you take a walk (public transit fam, it's decent over here), and hand that shit over when you made sure feds ain't watching.\\n\\n\\nSo where do I fit into this? I'll keep it short since I don't wanna dwell on past fuck-ups too much. I'm currently in my mid-20s, med-school dropout, slow-as-mud recovering fiend and wageslave. 5K in the hole to boot, turns out you can't spend your academic scholarship on dope and coke when you end up dropping out two semesters in. Who'd a thought?! I don't fit into this scene at all, but it got me out of many sketchy situations where people who looked a bit more down on their luck to put it mildly got stopped and searched. Sat next to a cop on the train home with a gram and a half under my tongue, thank fuck it was wrapped up good.\\n\\n\\nOne of my more recent memories is meeting up at a train station which I will not disclose since it was pretty close to where I live. Wait for the d-boy to show up, he takes us on a wild goose chase around the city. First he has to pick up a recipe at the pharmacy (benzos, what else), then he starts getting into a public shouting match with a customer we ran into who had wronged him in the past (way to keep this discreet!). Randomly he stops to smoke his shitty spice, telling me to position myself in a way to hide him doing the deed. After a while he tells us to wait in a local park, he's gotta go to the source, break up the dope and bag it up. I am hurting at this point, it's been 24 hours. I hand him my 80 bucks though, since he's been trustworthy in the past and commence to lay down on a park bench. So here we are, four fiends growing more and more nervous every minute, pacing up and down, peeking down the street he left for. One hour, two hours. I'm starting to put this down as a loss when he walks up like an angel bringing the gospel of soon-to-be shot dope. Next thing we  head down to the local fixing room and prompty get denied. It's full apparently, fuck that's what I get for copping during junkie rush hour. We ask if we can be admitted into the other rooms out back, but they're apparently reserved for people smoking crack and dope, we're not allowed to shoot up back there since they can't guarantee we'll be attended to in the way appropriate for someone injecting (no staff, no clean needles to hand out, yadda yadda).\\n\\n\\nWe say fuck this, walk a few roads down to the next park and shoot up using our nasty ass rigs with the numbers off, as well as our dull as fuck needles. It did the job done more than well, I nod out immediately, my using \u201ebuddies\u201c take off with my cotton and rig (lol), the cops mistake me for a drunk (it was Oktoberfest season), all is well.\\n\\n\\nSo that was that. If anyone is interested, I'll see if I can think of another story.

He told me when they came back around from the store cops, paramedics were there. And the coroners were carrying the body out by that time... So he died! I said why didn't you just burn him and keep it moving? Why not just befriend him, or atleast call 911 for him? Still would of walked away with everything as planned?!?!

Like I said don't believe it and think what you want and do me a favor and go to the nearest/tallest bridge closest to you and jump off head first to do the world a favor...\\n\\nWho knows maybe he made up the story all together?

Your literally the only one so far being the biggest asshole for no reason!?!? Every time I responded to your fishing comments I agreed that he's a piece of shit and deserves the same or worse because of what he's done(but I'm defending him, so you say?). You're a fucking joke and do me a favor please and block me or tell me how to block you if that's possible since I'm new and made my account about a month or so ago?!?! I'm definitely annoyed since all I did was share a story that Was told to me and I get you saying dumb shit, like why even comment at all? Again you know everyone on here so well that they will all think exactly like you(since again you state nothing but your opinion). \\n\\nYou make no sense saying I'm defending him. Literally agreed with you that he should be locked up, killed, etc... Numerous times you've stated your done here but continue? Please elaborate on how I'm a POS? Why would I not get along with the people(met and gained relationships with many fantastic people who apparently like me)? What bullshit is there to call? I'm sure you probably looked at my page/history so tell me what have I shared her that's such bullshit?\\n\\nPLEASE IF ANYTHING READ THIS PART AND TILL THE END... The story could be false/fake since I was told it by once a close friend that I would of considered a brother (never denied that but I believe it to be true!) I agreed several times he's a POS and deserves the worst happen to him!(but you say I defend?) have received nothing but love by the community (you say they'll call bullshit on me?) since I wrote this \"fake\" story yet you say I'm the person in the story? I could point out all of your contradictions but I don't have that much energy since I'm tired. \\n\\nLastly idk where your from? Guessing nowhere or nothing like where I'm from since the story I posted is an everyday occurrence! Literally I've seen people fall out on sidewalk and do you know what happens next before anyone calls for help if they call? The person usually is with other users and they start by dipping pockets, backpacks,wallet, etc. then when that's done they either step over them and continue with their day and don't notify anyone for help or they do! Either way the people are robbing you and hopefully call for help... Happens in my neighborhood all the time, everyday, numerous times a day! So for this story to be false is pretty slim since I've seen it happen plenty...\\n\\nDetective please explain to me how you can tie this to a homicide and not accidental? Being as though it's very frequent that people in shooting galleries fall out and are left by many users in the property with no help and since no one knows that there's a person on the floor with needle in arm turning blue they are found minutes, hours, days after!!! \\n\\nAnyway to block each other? I'd love that if we could do that so much!!! Go on YouTube and search drugs inc., Philly Dope (documentary) and BBC 1 I believe has a documentary of my neighborhood also... Maybe just maybe you will learn that it's real around here and the story I posted could very well be as real as you being a pussy ass punk as mother fucker???

It's not, guy. I can only speak for myself in this, but if anyone I have ever in my life known had done anything like this, there is no way they would tell me about it in a \"war stories\" conversation after I hadn't seen them in 10 years or however long you said. No one I know would be dumb enough to admit to premeditated murder in a conversation with someone they haven't seen in forever because you can't trust that the circumstances of the other person's life haven't changed so much that they won't get reported to the police. Also, and more important, there is no one that would ever assume that I would be OK with murder for the purposes of running the pockets of a junkie who isn't likely to have much besides almost a brick on them. I guess you are the kind of guy that people not only confide their deepest darkest secrets in.

You can get a pulmonary embolism if this solution gets hung up in the lungs, a heart attack if it goes to the coronary arteries, or a stroke if this gets to the brain.

I was \"the man\" 19 with more money than I care to admit, and was well known and respected by many.\\nAll of that changed.\\n\\nMy PIC caught a federal trafficking case, and it just so happened I was supposed to go down with him. They had a case on me, and my lawyer told me to lay fucking low or I'm going down.\\n\\nWell I quit dealing, but my dope habit sprawled out of control.\\n\\nMy girlfriend of 6 years began having physical arguements. Bitch wanted me to give her more spending money every month (AS IF 7k on bullshit every month isn't enough money).\\n\\nAnywho, one day I lose it. My PIC called my mom from prison and told her I needed help. I'll never forget that day. I remember I smoked a blunt and prepped my shot, I stand up and look in the mirror.\\nI just see an empty skeleton of death.\\nI didn't want to die. I just wanted to have fun and feel good.\\n\\nI know im rambling, I just need to vent.\\n\\nSo now fast forward 2 rehabs and 4 IOPS, I am currently a year away from graduating, my GPA is a 3.8 and I have a lovely \"normie\" girlfriend.\\n\\nProblem you might ask? I'm still a junky. I occasionally slip myself some etizolam once every few weeks knowing good and damn well where it leads me.\\nI am not sure about you all, but our society is so fucked in the head.\\nI just had an altercation with a girl who told me anyone who uses drugs should be sent to a CONCENTRATION CAMP. It took everything inside of me to fight back what I really wanted to say to her.\\nGod i dont know guys. I just feel like each and every day I am slowly losing it and eventually I am gonna snap and relapse, because thats what I know best.\\nMy parents and I have never had a close relationship. Dad wasn't around until my teens, and was a huge factor in my drug habits.\\nThe shittiest part? I tell my parents (divorced) everyday (well not so much anymore) that I've always wanted to have a happy family and be close with them. They never reciprocate.\\n\\nMy mom and I are decently close, and she never gave up on me, even when shit got rough so I know one day we will be in a good place.\\nbut my dad? Everyday I debate whether I should block that side of the families phone number.\\nThey never genuinely take interest in me, and when I seldom do go to their home they are quite honestly just mean people. I am part of a larger family and the way they treat the younger kids, and other people in general is just not something I want in my life.\\n\\nBut hey, I'm off drugs right? Thats all they ever cared about. They dont give a flying fladoodle whats going on inside my head. They just want that clean piss test.\\n\\nFucking christ what a rant. I don't have any support in my life, nobody to talk about this shit and if I learned anything its that I need to get this shit out and into the world.\\n\\nSo for anyone whos read this far. Thank you - I really take comfort in that, and I hope that things in your life are going well. If theres anything to take from this, I guess let it be to tell those you care about, that you love them.

Finally called my dad, said I need help and have no other options, was gonna be evicted and all that good stuff. In 5 days I'll be 3 months clean. I drink like crazy though and have to hide that too. My dad only sees my 2 beers every night, I'll hide a bottle of whiskey in my room and drink a couple extra beers every night when I go out to smoke a cig.

I\u2019m going spend time  on things that I love, making music,( learn an instrument, it\u2019s helped me a lot), time with friends, again new hobby...   I would also suggest a taper for the kratom, there\u2019s threads on it you can find on blue light or on here I think... just google it.

I got prescribed Suboxone 8mg per day and am supposed to see a Sub doc on Wednesday. \\n\\nI also was taking 6 grams per day of Phenibut on average along with ~30 - 40 grams of Kratom before detox. During the 6 days I was in detox, they pumped me with a shitload of Phenobarbital for the Phenibut piece of the puzzle - 194.4 mgs for a few days, then a quick taper down to 64.8mg the day of discharge last Thursday. They then set me free with 5 32.4 mg pills as needed basically. I took two (64.8 mg on Friday), and on accident (seriously) took three yesterday 97.2mg. I meant to save the last for tonight but forgot I'd already taken two, to make the comedown smoother but whatever. I also was feeling incredibly anxious last night so I broke down and took 3 grams of Phenibut.

I really don't see myself just not taking any more Phenibut suddenly just because I got a weeks worth of Phenobarbital tapered extremely quickly. I'm sure I can skip the day dose of Phenibut. I can prob go down to 1.5 or 2 grams of Phenibut at night and taper down. At detox they didn't seem concerned giving me a hardcore, long acting barbituate in high doses with 8mg Suboxone - they only monitored my vitals in the morning, and let me sleep on huge doses of it alone in my room. I was a fucking total zombie the first two/three days: no memory of what was going on. I'm with it now and trying to figure out a plan here.\\n\\nAny thoughts? I don't know what to do exactly. I feel like they just staved off the Phenibut w/d with a barbituate and now I'm on an opiate that causes respiratory depression which Kratom didn't.

The guy who runs AA around here was a former dope addict for years and now uses the occasional p0ds, tramadol, some vicodins here and there. Nobody knows at AA of course, but I knew him outside AA and in my contact circles.\\n\\nThe structure and \"rules\" of AA are what they are. If they were flexible, it wouldn't be a program. Just remember the people ARE flexible. Don't forget that everyone is different. When I use cannabis for example, I usually get too high without any euphoria, but I'm too high to be craving opioids. Meanwhile there are several friends of mine that crave dope nonstop the moment they take that second drag off a joint and the first one is hitting them. \\n\\nOnly you know what can actually work for you. This is determined by both intuitive and experience (aka fucking up). Just don't do yourself a disservice by not learning from your mistakes. That's the WORST.\\n\\nIf AA just means being sober once or twice a week, then it's a success for what it is. At the very least it's an opportunity to talk with others going through the very same thing as you. And think about it, if open discussion of using other drugs to \"fix\" your DoC addiction, you'll just be triggering other people. If in your mind, say, alcohol and cannabis aren't as bad as opioids, you might talk about how great it is to be a \"week clean\" after drinking Gin two nights and smoking a blunt with the boys on Friday. You might have just triggered several dudes who are \"only\" in there for booze or weed. That's not helpful."}], "du3rgda": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-02-11 18:20:08", "1_text": "Idk man, it gets even worse when I have to front him a double order with half payment because he knows he will want more next week but that we will meet at AA, and because he gives like 3 junkies a ride he knows we could never swap over p0ds and pills with them around. So essentially I'm going to AA to pick up cash which is sorta fucked. Maybe he just wants to find a way to force me to go. Either way I want to check it out for sure.\\n\\nAs for chipping/using other drugs, I totally get it. I chipped opioids for 7 fucking years once or twice a month max with at least 3mo off completely per year, and even a few years of none at all. You feel so empowered by being able to keep it under control...until you don't have it under control. It's one sparking depression-causing event away from full on use.\\n\\nYou think this or that serves as a functional gatekeeper. Stuff like your availability isn't there, or you only are an abuser of circumstances like having a surgery, or that cost will remain prohibitive.\\n\\nI thought so too until I got into the p0d trade a few years back before they were essentially banned. It was 100's of $ worth of Oxy in morphine and thebaine for $20. Endless availability. Then when those went away I found alternatives that I refuse to mention. Again $10 for at least $100+ in dope. Even without that gem there's always nearly pure dope online on the DNMs for like $60/g of fire tar or $120-200/g of the purest ecp you've ever seen in your life, all fent test strip-negative.\\n\\nNext thing you know you've got 3-4 solid friends who start copping off you even though you never asked to sell, and you justify it as \"well at least they won't OD on fent I'm doing them a service.\" Well great, now you've found a way to use for free for fucking ever at the expense of your friendships.\\n\\nWhile those chipping years were fun, it's all romanticized man. People refer to opioids in their teenage years similar to girlfriends. While it felt great, we are talking 3 hr of a quality buzz every once in a while. \\n\\nSo yeah, some people seriously need to go clean. I WDed off the equivalent of a methadone+ Morphine XR habit for over a month and felt like shit for half a year. Convinced myself that chipping was possible again. Did I relapse into regular use from that first time? No, but it slowly crept up again.\\n\\nHere I am not even able to get high off of 100g of opium p0ds, or like 20 p0d heads. All it took was like 3 weeks of 2x/week use to ruin my tolerance back to what it was. \\n\\nI'm not saying chipping isn't possible...but is it worth it? You really can't answer that question until you've used well into adulthood for 5+ years. I used to think I was able to manage it, but it really was just those structural \"blocks\" that maintained my use. Only those that can genuinely be handed a $5000 bag of pure dope for free and STILL are able to chip can truly say it's capable and worth it. \\n\\nThe rest just don't know the answer to whether they can truly chip or not. The worst part is if you've moved onto the daily high dose grind, you can absolutely obliterate your tolerance semi-permanently in just a few months or 1-2 years. Now you've gone and fucked up the opioid euphoria for the next 50+ years of your life.\\n\\nWhen you've been through this cycle like myself and others, you learn that the only real answer is to pretty much not use at all. The cost-benefit just isn't worth it.\\n\\nSure you could put in an entire year or two clean, after dealing with ~2-6mo of PAWS and whatever issues you had before the using, all to just use again and hope it is great.\\n\\nAll I can say is I've had more than one friend tell me, after one or even TWO years of being completely clean no kratom no suboxone no anything, and yet straight up that doses like 120 or 160mg instant release guaranteed-not-pressed- Oxycodone literally felt like \"2/10 am I feeling it\" to them. I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it myself. \\n\\nSometimes enough's enough, you know? You'll know when that is.

I'm ordering some kratom extracts this coming week but I know it's very unlikely I'll even get off.\\n\\nI was dumb enough to think that as long as my use wasn't costing me a lot (it was only like $6 a day back when my source of opioids was still available, and that's $6 to be 250mg methadone-tier nodding out) and as long as my DoC causes no physical damage (opioids), and as long as my DoC had very low OD risk, that there was no logical reason for not using.\\n\\nI didn't realize that post-dependency depression and the like is very real and extremely sucks. What's even worse is that the kindling effect is VERY real, even if you go months or even a year without use. Your tolerance permanently raises more quickly, there's permanently less euphoria after that first relapse, there's stronger WDs that can come back even with only a week of use, and then after that week of use your WDs can and will come back just from a 2 day going hard binge.\\n\\nIt's just a shit wrap that's plain not worth it.

I was using basically every day, maybe a half gram to a gram or so, but it was pretty bunk shit, so take that with a grain of salt, it wasn't a HUGE habit or anything. So I went four days without using and my withdrawal symptoms were basically subsiding, RLS was subsiding big, I could actually get comfortable, still getting the chills and having diarrhea, but for the most part a mild day four. Well I used like 0.2 that night and went like two more days without using, but I was definitely experiencing WD symptoms slightly worse than I was on day four prior, but still not bad, just sweating like a mfer at night.\\n\\nSo yesterday I needed to work a job outside for 8 hours straight. I'm starting to umpire youth baseball. So even though the WD symptoms weren't horrible by any means, the last thing I wanted was to be having the chills and hot/cold sweats while being outside in the cold and wind for 8 hours straight.\\n\\nSo, I dosed about 0.25mg of sub, and it was enough to make me feel good, like I was completely clean. No euphoria or anything, just clean. Well it has now been 38 hours since I dosed that and I'm starting to get the chills again, so obviously I'm starting to WD from the sub.\\n\\nI start a new job on Thursday the 15th and *really* do not want to be having any WD symptoms when I start. In y'all's experience, do you think I should be fine by then? Do you think the WD I'll experience up until then will even be that severe? I know sub WD is supposed to peak around 72 hours, so I'm hoping it won't be too bad since I'm half way there and only have minimal symptoms, but I also know that sub WD can last a really long time, and I'm worried about not being over it by Thursday, or worst case scenario, having the WD be so drawn out that I don't start feeling really shitty until the middle of the week.\\n\\nAny help is appreciated!", "2_timestamp": "2018-02-12 01:04:51", "comments": [{"Dammit234": [{"du3zj35": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-02-11 21:02:34", "1_text": "If you have the subs, just keep taking as you WD but get smaller and smaller slices and go those 36 to 48 hours if you can. .1 or .05 will help.

If you have those or at least the first three, getting through the first couple days is so much easier.

Suboxone will, for the most part, take care of that post acute crap.  This is why I always urge people I \"counsel\" to be realistic about quitting and do what works for them.  If the post acute symptoms and depression are going to make you relapse, and suboxone is the only way you're going to stay off the dope then by all means use it as a tool to get your life back.

This is where the internet is your friend because it is not illegal to ship these supplies to stubborn states that won't let you buy OTC.\\n\\nI can name a few very reputable and very reasonable places to get luer lock barrels, Micron filters, and I'd only suggest bacteriostatic water vial and 0.9% saline if you plan on buying or you get pills or H in bulk and want to just make an IV/IM ready vial for the whole month otherwise it isn't that necessary. \\n\\nYou can boil tap water if need be.

The first initial push stung like a mofo but didn't really burn after that sting when I tried pushing it in very very slow to see if the sting would happen again. It is kind of strange because I kept puling the plunger back to make sure i was still registered throughout. I went really slow and injected the H probably over 60 seconds. \\n\\n1) I have hit an artery before (Or nerve) and it also stung and burned in those situations so I've had to pull the whole rig out. There was one time I was very naive (sometimes still am) and kept pushing the plunger in while it burned but whole area was so numb from it I didn't feel much pain when doing that. (1A) - but Do you guys think shooting into an artery would sting throughout the whole shot? (1B) And do you think it's possible that the needle tip was just partially in my vein and out at the same time where it could register blood, but also 'miss' partially if injected?\\n\\nNot sure if it matters but the vein I used is really small. It kind of runs over the pink knuckle and is barely visible. \\n\\n2) After the shot, the area around it, about a 1 inch circumference, became alittle raised and random raised bumps showed up on my wrist and forarm also. Do you think that's an allergic reaction, or from a partial miss or definitely artery hit? Besides those raised areas, nothing else is puffy like when I hit an artery before. Also, nothing really hurts.\\n\\n3) Random question I always wondered, When you guys put the cotton in the dope to draw up, how big of a piece do you use and do you actually stick the needle tip into the piece of cotton or just kind of push the tip against it and apply pressure while drawing it up? \\n\\nThanks all!

I'm breaking down.", "1_text": "I quit IV Herion 8 days ago, I did cave and snort one bag because of horrible stomach pain thats from a virus I got about tuesday/wednesday. TBH I've had 3 stomach conditions for years and since about last june it just seems to have gotten worse. Doctors can't find anything even with MRI's and Catscans, the works. I've had two tell me they see this sometimes and they say with abdominal pain it's tricky. They know I'm in pain and not faking, but sometimes they just can't fix it ever. Both said it's possible I may just have to live with it forever. I'm only 28. While this bug has put me in so bad pain I've slept one night in a week and only a few hours and eat about half a cliff bar a day. Even when I haven't had this virus the pain is less but it never, ever, goes away. I'd give anything to have like knee pain or something but this constant burning knife in my stomach is hard to imagine living with forever. That's really about 80% of the reason I was using H and stealing even while on probation which I've violated. There's only so much I can take. Recently me and my coppin partner/partner in making money how we can just haven't been able to make half what we used to and the 9/10 dope that used to be around just dissapeared. I was shooting bundles and giving the feeling a 1/10. I just got tired of being dopesick 50% so I quit. I don't even care about the one bag today I sniffed. It was just to get a couple hours of relief. I don't plan on going back on H.\\n\\nI know this will sound weird but while my buddy is still struggling to get off the garbage dope, I started smoking crack which to everyones surprise helped me quick dope. I'm not really into stimulants and it's definitely not my drug of choice but theres so much chaos in my life right now even 5 minutes of a dopamine rush is bliss and I was attracted to the non physically addicting part.\\n\\nMy fiance dumped me almost the same day I quit H. She never found out about my addiction. It was other issues that caused the split. I still love her and avoided contact until wednesday which was a mistake. She acted happy as a peach(she was faking which I will explain later). That crushed me. My mom is sick of my addiction even though I don't live with her and now wants nothing to do with me. Literally the only family member who still had my back after I went to prison for felony assault which I got for fighting back when my brother tried to murder me. My state has no self defense laws.\\n\\nEvery day gets worse. This virus is 4 times worse than my dopesick was. I know its hard to believe because IV dopesick is bad but thats really how bad this virus is. Even though I should be in bed, mentally I can't sit in my room alone. So sick as fuck, I go around making money in non moral ways and buy crack while my friend gets dope.\\n\\nI think the only person who gives a shit about me is that addict friend. In 6 months, even when I just met him as a middle man, he has never beat me out of a dollar. We split everything 50/50 and we trust eachother completely. I've pawned everything but my computer.\\n\\nLast night I couldn't breathe in my room and slept downstairs. When i woke up 2 hours later, I went to take my meds. I've been prescribed klonopin for 10 years because I got a brain injury in a car accident and it just fucked my circuits. No non benzo helps at all. I should have had about 23 in my bottle and when I went to take it there was fucking 3. I had a problem in the summer and noticed a few were going missing here and there but never like this. I have to go to the hospital in the morning and hope they give me the 5/6 day supply I need until my refill. In the summer when whichever roommate stole a bit too much I was only 1 day short and the hospital was really cool and gave it to me based on my word and I was out in 20 minutes. I'm hoping since this is only the 2nd time they won't give me a problem but its also 5/6 worth of kpins instead of 1 and I really don't want to have to file a police report which is what my doctor requires if I go to her. I live with 4 people but it's a big house and I rarely see the 2 other renters. The other 2 are my landlady and her BF and I trust them and let them know the situation. One other renter is an ex addict and the other is just really weird. She thinks its the ex addict but hes been clean 8 years and I just hate to imagine him doing me dirty like that. Benzos are not a medicine to fucking take from someone considering the WD possibilities.\\n\\nTo top it off, my ex fiance texted me about an hour ago she tried to kill herself yesterday. She wouldn't tell me much but it sounds like she tried to cut her wrists and her brother just happened to come into her room at the right time. Instead of being supportive her family screamed at her and told her she was fucking crazy.\\n\\nThe breakup is so fresh and once I get my shit together she said there's a chance we could try again(this was wednesday). This is the second time I've been engaged. I tried to tell her to talk to me because I know that feeling of wanting to end it all very, very well and I would understand. She still wouldn't open up, said she wants to try again a different way and then cut me off the phone.\\n\\nI've already had a hard time keeping it together lately. As it is, next month, because I have a nice PO, hes only recommending and increase in probation level instead of jail time even though I've gotten two charges. As long as the judge agrees ill get another year on strict probation which if i carry on the way I am now I'll violate very fast. I have 8 years backup time plus whatever they'd give me for the new charges.\\n\\nI will die before I do that much time locked up. The time I did already broke me and made me a worse person. Jail hurts more than rehabilitates.\\n\\nI think just hearing the attempted suicide tonight was my breaking point. I broke down and cried and could barely breathe. If i got a call she does it again and does succeed then I honestly don't know if I could handle it. I want to marry this girl and she wants to die at 23 because she's having a bad week?\\n\\nI know this is not the usual type of post on here but I have really no one and this is a great community.

About 20 more mins later I could definitely feel a small opiate buzz but definitely not stronger than one oxy has given me before. We decided that we should just finish off the rest of the pill. We also decided that rolling a joint would be a good course of action. By the time I was almost done rolling, I could definitely feel the buzz. We finished off the pill and started smoking the joint, sharing it with his roommate.

Think about what its going to do for you right now, in 5 minutes, 30 minutes, a few hours, how its going to impact tomorrow and the day after, how its going to impact this day next month, how its going to impact the other aspects of your life that you don't currently have on the forefront of your thought process... like your relationships, your finances, your mental health, your physical appearance, even your appetite! Your ability and desire to do things like building new relationships, set and to achieve goals, go to the gym, eat properly, provide for the ones you love, be there for the ones who need you, be able to react in emergency situations, this list can go on forever. But im just saying, just for a moment, consciously/figuratively/even literally take a step back, and think long, deep, and hard (ha-ha for whoever makes the joke) about where the decision will or where it could take you. If ANY of the conclusions that you come to of where the decision could potentially take you are places that you dont or would never want to be at, that right there should be enough information and all you need to recognize that the decision has more bad than good to it, and maybe you'll pass it up this time. There is always next time. And hopefully next time you do this same exact thing and come to the same exact conclusion.\\n\\nI can tell you one thing that is factual: You DO NOT want to live the lifestyle of an addict, whether it be opiates, stimulants, alcohol, etc., you do not want to live this life.

For the first time, i am actively in the life of an addict.\\n\\nAlso one other random protip: NEVER SHOOT COKE. Me, i have always been a downers person, never enjoyed stimulants much at all, always made me feel shitty that night and the next day physically and just never felt much out of sniffing coke, no matter how good or how much i did. One night i was in a tinychat and i was told that IV coke is an ENTIRELY different drug than when it is snorted. I thought what the heck, i dont like stims theres no way i could get hooked on that, besides ive sold coke for years and never got hooked on it, i never even do it when i have free coke left over from ounces. After i shot coke, it became the most fiendish high i have ever chased my god. I am not aware of the dangers of how much is needed in a single shot to overdose or how much over a certain period of time, and i dont even enjoy the high that much, but since i no longer feel much a rush from shooting H, and the immediate rush and physical/auditory changes i feel from shooting a good dose of coke have made me practically mix a shot every 15-30 minutes until its gone at any point that i have coke. ive easily shot at least a quarter ounce of coke over the last week, and thats probably lowballing.

It is simply perfect suffering. If someone had to engineer the perfect physical torture it would be withdrawal.

I lost more than 5 jobs while going to the clinic because they didn't give a fuck I worked 1st shift. Both of the clinics I went to I had to see a therapist biweekly for an hour each time and a doctors appointment to renew the script every 60 days. Didn't give a rats ass that my work hours didn't work with their hours and I had to leave work early or go in late minimum of 2 days a month. With companies on an attendance point system, it doesn't take long to point out while trying to maintain a normal life doing the right thing.

So yesterday was my birthday and I was calling texting around trying to find some 30s i already had some but wanted more. Anyways I called 2 of my main dealers but they were out for the month. So I text this one guy I use to deal with couple months back always did me right and when I sold to him I always did him right. Well I text him and see if he still had the 15s he texted me about Friday I was gonna grab them from him 4 for 50. He replied back and was like  \"I can get some 30s how many do you want?\" I replied and told him 3. Well we decided to meet up at a store that really busy all hours of the day right down the road from my house. 5 or 10 minutes pass and I'm waiting for my buddy i don't see him but I see this black guy walking down the road from my buddy's house (mind you my buddy is white I'm talking about). So this black guy goes in the store and is in there mayne 5 minutes then he starts walking to my car knock on the window and Is like \"you tyler?\" I was like \"yeah\" he said \"trey wanted me to bring you these he didn't want alot of traffic at his house\". So I'm looking at these and I can barely see a imprint it almost looked like they hit some water. He was telling me they were the real deal and shit but I was like nah bro I'm good but I'll give you a ride back up the hill to his house. So I head back home then my so call buddy trey text me and Is like \"hey I got some other ones you can read they are the E8s\" he sent a pic and everything they were the real E8s. I guess he thought he was gonna give them fucked up ones to me but I didn't want them cause I felt sketched about them.  Anyways after about 10 or 15 minutes I went up to his house actually which was a bad idea I should of told him to meet me at the gas station again. So this black guy comes back out gets in the car and the first thing I see in his hand is a baggie of the E8s my eyes are focused on them and not even him. All the sudden this black guy says \"just give me the money\" I said \"what do you mean?\" He then pulls out a glock shows me that there is a round in the chamber. Sooo at the point I was trying to stay calm, I also had my Ruger SR9 on my side and my CCW he could not see that at all. So I say \"you gonna shoot me if I don't give you this money?\" He said \"nah I ain't gonna do anything if you just give me the money.\" So now I'm like fuck it I don't know this guy, I don't wanna get shot let me give this little $90 so he can get the hell out my car. I wanted to just get out the car turn around draw my gun and shoot his ass through the window but that would of looked like a drug deal gone bad or some shit plus the gun was still on me. So when I did hand him the money he was like nah that ain't all you got.. So I gave this other 10.00 in my pocket I also dropped my phone between the seat so he wouldn't try and get that and i left my wallet at home since I was just gonna be 5 minutes. So after he got that 10 he got out and started waking back into the house. I thought at that moment should I pull gun out and at least try and wound him in the leg while he isn't looking? I didn't want shoot him In the back as much as I wanted to I know that was a big no no. So honestly I just let it walk cause either way if I shot him and the police came wondering why I shot him I had no legitimate reason why i did other then he pulled a gun on me.. there's a always a reason. I also thought if I did shoot him and the police came I was gonna tell them I was meeting him to buy something off the App letgo, I had no messaging proof for that though.  I honestly don't know if i did the right thing or not. I wasn't gonna call the law after that situation.. Idk i was calm during the situation kind of but my mind was blank that's the first time anything like that has ever happened to me. My life is more valuable then a $100 cause I didn't know that guy I didn't know if he was gonna shoot me or not.. So idk if I did the right thing or the wrong thing.

I've seen scummy ass d-boys bragging about getting head from junkies for 20 rocks or small amounts of dope etc to their friends/fellow dealers like it's some badge of honor or something cool. It's really just fucking sad to be honest.\\n\\nNot saying all d-boys are like this.

Please help me figure it out", "1_text": "I\u2019m on mobile so sorry for any formatting errors. \\n\\nI\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for 4 years and I have always known that he deals with severe pain on a daily basis. He was born with a deformity in his hip that causes the joint and socket to slowly disintegrate over time. He will eventually need a hip replacement. He\u2019s also been in two serious motorcycle accidents in the last 10 years. The most recent one was about 3 years ago, and he almost died. He had a punctured lung and shattered his kneecap along with injuring several vertebrae. He was in the hospital for about a week and out of work for several months. He was given pain medication in the hospital but when he got out he was drug tested before the doctor would refill his prescription and he failed for weed. So the doctor gave him Motrin which he never took. I know this is true because I read the paperwork, even I was like wtf. As far as I know he has no legitimate prescriptions for any opiates. \\n\\nHe is the kind of guy that doesn\u2019t like to show weakness and tries to be very masculine and macho in that sense. I know that he is in pain every day because I hear him whimpering in the morning when he thinks I\u2019m asleep. He\u2019s becoming more immobile and after work he just comes home and sits on the couch smoking weed until he goes to bed. He\u2019s very stubborn and is terrified of the doctor so he just \u201ctoughs it out\u201d and refuses to talk to me about it (which is another big but unrelated problem in our relationship). So when he exhibits the behavior I\u2019m about to describe and I ask him wtf is up he just says he\u2019s \u201cfine.\u201d \\n\\nNow I personally don\u2019t do opiates, and I actually think I\u2019m allergic because they make me feel really sick and weird and itchy every time I take them. However, I\u2019ve seen people nodding off and have had friends that abuse them, so I feel like I know what it looks like. Over the past 3 or 4 months he\u2019s been acting really fucking suspect and it seems like he\u2019s fucked up for the following reasons:\\n\\nHe comes home from work and immediately goes into the bathroom for like 45 minutes. When I ask him what he\u2019s doing he\u2019s says he\u2019s taking a shit and that I need to leave him alone. Ok, that sounds plausible, but still weird to me since it\u2019s like the same exact time frame like 4 days out of the week.\\n \\nHe just passes out on the couch, like head back mouth open passed out. It doesn\u2019t seem like regular \u201csleeping\u201d and for someone that claims to only smoke weed (he never drinks) it\u2019s seems really fucking odd to me. It gets to the point that I have to shake him and then he wakes up. Sometimes for a minute then goes right back to \u201csleeping\u201d or is just awake. \\n\\nHis mother is prescribed Vicodin and I know he \u201coccasionally\u201d takes one for his pain. He claims to only take it when it\u2019s so bad that he can\u2019t move. He frequently gets very defensive when questioned and says \u201cI\u2019m not a fucking junkie.\u201d \\n\\nHe\u2019s a generally grumpy dude, but sometimes he just seems really high and way happier than usual. I\u2019ve been chalking that up to the fact that he\u2019s a pothead but my gut is telling me something else is happening. \\n\\nHe\u2019s also constantly broke despite working a full time job. It\u2019s not a great job, it\u2019s in a kitchen, but still. You should have some money and I don\u2019t think weed and your car insurance costs your entire paycheck. \\n\\nHis general demeanor lately has been really uncharacteristic. Like extremely angry and just not giving a fuck about me or anything really. This past weekend was my birthday and he passed out on the couch at like 8pm with his head back and his mouth open. I kept checking his breathing and waking him up because it scared me. I told him all of this and how I think he was on something and he laughed and said he was \u201ctired.\u201d Wtf.\\n\\nI\u2019m not a fucking idiot and I kind of think I already know this is what\u2019s happening, but I would like some outside validation. Like I said, I don\u2019t do opiates and idk if some people just sleep like that or if it\u2019s indicative of being on something. I just want to say that I\u2019m not judging anyone that does this, but I\u2019m scared for him and I need to know if this is what I\u2019m dealing with. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to reply. \\n\\nTLDR\\n\\nBoyfriend passes out all the time, acts weird, has chronic pain issues and I think he\u2019s abusing opiates but I don\u2019t know for sure.

I'm three years sober after 25 years drunk, like at minimum a fifth per day but usually a handle or more.  I was confronted many times by friends and family but it never actually got me to quit living in denial.  I was highly functional, two houses, a beach house, could retire at 38 had I wanted to, but I was killing myself and wanted to quit, but I didn't want to quit at the same time.  What worked for me was when I saw a way out, a way that would actually work, a plan and an honest recognition of what I was doing.  But, I was shown love, but not pessimistic and shameful love, not regret for my prior actions, instead I was shown love and optimism.  My wife and family were smiles and cheerful and helped me change my attitude to focus on what I WILL be, not what I have been.  Learn and be cognizant of the past, keep those memories as reminders but don't let them defeat and define me.  I could be that person I was before my addiction, with love and dreams and ambition and hope and joy, all the things I suppressed to avoid the other feelings such as anxiety, depression, sadness.  I went into rehab halfheartedly, thinking I'd get through withdrawals, they'd get me well enough to get out in a couple of months then I could socially drink again in a year or so.  Nope.  I relapsed twice for short spells.  Today I've had to learn to not actually want to be on a mind-altering substance, not just not do it, but not actually want it.  It took me a couple of years of sobriety before I felt this way, had to relearn what it meant to face issues head on, honestly, good or bad.  Attitude was HUGE, problems seem so small when a person doesn't let their mind conflate them.  My anxiety lessened so much and was no longer debilitating.  I now see a psychiatrist as well as attend a weekly meeting in an out-patient addiction recovery program.  I go to AA but only once per week and it's not really my thing.\\n\\nSo, if your boyfriend is abusing opiates and you want to stay with him but want to help him get off of them then I would suggest being open, honest, but kind regarding his use.  Anything else will likely be met with him avoiding or trying to shut down the conversation.  If he's addicted to the drug then it's his #1 concern, or likely anyway, and that's in no way your fault, it's what addiction does to an addicts brain and priorities in life.  I love my wife and kids more than myself, but not enough to get me to stop drinking, I had to make that decision based on my want to stop killing myself, ruining my family, losing those I love so much.  But honesty and love go much further than accusations and resentment, that never works. \\n\\nGood luck.  Oh, and if it turns out he is addicted then you might want to find a local nar-anon meeting and attend, you don't have to speak but my wife has told me the al-anon she goes to occasionally has really helped her to understand her feelings were justified, something I was rejecting for years."}]}], "Iledahorsetowater": [{"du5qco7": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-02-12 19:48:10", "1_text": "Does he say something to the effect of, \u201cNo baby, I\u2019m just really tired.\u201d\\n\\n\\n##He\u2019s on opiates.

Not just by nodding out though, he could be taking benzos and nodding in and out. However, it doesn't take 45 minutes to do a benzo whether popping, or some snort. And the other thing you said his money is always gone so that's an indication since an opiate addiction will drain your funds quickly. I remember working a full time job and had to pay rent, car insurance, internet, etc, but someone tried calculating my income with all the expenses and it'd still come out to like having +$300 weekly, but i'd have nothing at all and they'd ask where my money was going. How is your BF's sex drive though? One thing for sure is taking enough of it will kill his mood. At least for me, doing enough heroin does that to me. However, if i do a small amount, it actually helps me last longer sometimes (not always). If he has no drive at all and can't get hard, prob def abusing opiates. However, all of this is just an assumption, so without really knowing him or seeing him, it could all be a coincidence.

This was my relationship to a T before I found out my bf was using heroin. The being in the bathroom for long periods of time, falling asleep MID conversation, head back and mouth open, always saying he was just \"tired\".. all of it! It was always a question/feeling in the back of my mind but I never wanted to believe it. I knew he had some issues w pills in the past before I met him and anytime the topic of heroin would come up, he'd never fail to reassure me that he's never done it. Maybe once.. but it was before we met.\\nIt got to the point where his actions were so obvious of him using that I had to take things into my own hands and investigate. There had been countless times of me asking if he had been using recently or currently, but of course he denied it. It was one night that we were cleaning our apartment and he was grabbing a blanket behind the couch and he passed out leaning over the couch....lol. I just stood there behind him, waiting for him to wake up, and ended up having to wake him up. I asked him wtf was up and what do ya know, his response was \"I'm just really tired\" haha yeah, okkkkk. It ended up being that night that I went through his wallet (his really old wallet that wasn't his current one mind you) that I noticed him carrying around recently, which also was glued to him that night, and I found the boy. I know it was wrong of me to go through his things, but I know any gf would have done the same if she were in my situation.\\n\\nOkay so super long story short (sorry for the novel haha didn't expect to get all into it), it deffffffinitey sounds like he's using. If you haven't confronted him already, I would do it now. But be sure to go into it with a very caring mindset and even though you might feel very angry/betrayed in some way, just reassure him that you just really care and love him and are just concerned (that's if you do feel that way, idk you're relationship at all but I assume that you do have those feelings).\\n\\nIf you have any questions or if I could help you in any sort of way, please PM me!

Bud and his running partner, aka ya boy right here, can hustle fine string instruments. Was that one of you guys though, or was Bud right and it was God? Because it worked out rather perfectly. \\n\\nBy the way if you remember from last post about the guy who was supposedly dying but in such a way that it was not at all considered a medical emergency, here's the update. I totally fucked that off, didn't even see Bud until way later than initially planned. One of the things I had to take care of before going to that trap was with my homegirl, Flail-Bot 3000. She flailed and fuckin flailed and I tried so hard to work with her and ended up leaving her stranded in a rock quarry and way late to the dude who was supposedly dying. Could've lived could've died, I don't know. \\n\\nSo last night Bud calls me. It was a discouraging day for the guy. If he didn't have concrete, verifiable progress to his moving out of the house by morning he was getting thrown out then and there. With for the most part just a cello to work with, and him and I being in the trade of hard drugs not string instruments, we weren't getting our hopes up. No cello sale then no reliable living, no necessary resources, no being a father to a son, no shelter until jail via racial profiling by the police, etc. Since he considered it his last night at the house and he was just alone in it, he wanted me to come over and spend it with him. I get there, we chainsmoke cigarettes while we have real talk, share stories and try to sell other smaller items for at least a little something. About 30 minutes in I have a sale for a watch I have lined up, another sale for another watch, and a trade, but then I a get *piiinggggggg* ya know, fb messenger? Some rando added me and asked, \"Hey man, how's it going? I heard you have a cello on the cheap I've been trying to get one within my budget.\" \\n\\nWell fuck me sideways friend, you can bet your own toned taternuts that I sure do! I show Bud the message, he grabs my phone staring it right in the fuckin screen with his eyes lit up accommodated by a huge smile and says, \"Oh my God! Is this real?\" And I'm not fuckin around here, just then his phone gets a *piingggggg* ya know the Facebook thing, yeah. It was another rando contacting him about buying the FUCKING CELLO. Bud and I read it together and in the same tone as 3 seconds before he says, \"Oh my god! What the fuck is happening?\" \\n\\nYou guys. Seriously please tell me if it was you or what, but within the next 50 minutes after the first ping, we had a total of 9 people hit us up for this cello. 3 hit me and 6 hit him, never met or heard of any of these people. From what we gathered, someone I know knows someone who knows someone who knows someone who mentioned a cheap cello at work where our buyer overheard it. We sold it to the first guy who hit me up 7 hours after he sent message, had the money in hand at 6AM this morning. \\n\\nSo again. \\n\\nI'm not fucking kidding please PM or something because I've never believed in miracles and I don't want to start now. I'm going to see Bud out of state within the next 4 days, and I'm going to miss the absolute shit out of him, but I wouldn't try to chain him here or make him feel bad because he's actively pursuing what he greatly values, which is his 2 year old son. I've been in some horrible, some great, some hilarious some unmentionable positions in my time in the drug scene, but so far this has been the fiasco that I value the most.\\n\\nFor the record, on the way to sell this thing in the early hours of morning driving down the highway, I told him he can for real tell me the actual origins of this cello, it's about to be over so just tell me I absolutely must know. Period. Like it's a thing. All he really could say was, \"I already told you, it just kinda showed up.\" I'm pretty sure there's a lesson to be learned from this little cello fiasco, like what they do at the end of South Park episodes, or King of the Hill? Is it persue your greater values even though you're pretty clearly just gonna fuck it up the more you try? I don't know. Either way I'm happy with the way it went.

Yesterday, I felt the most uncomfortable and painful feelings in my life. I used to do a lot of pills and cocaine when I was a teenager but grew out of that. Once I lost my brother I developed an alcohol addiction. Then, back in December, I shot heroin for the first time. \\n\\nBut before all I did was drink. I live with someone who has been a heroin addict for 5 years. I told him to go to a clinic and he agreed he would go. We had to pay $15 a day for a Methadone dose for him every morning. We used to work together and both lost our jobs because I was his manager and we were sleeping together. It's a bit more complicated than that though. He is from Romania and would screw up the register almost every night because he had trouble with our currency. My boss thought he was stealing from the drawer and would always ask me to keep an eye on him. Since I was always closing with him, and sleeping with him, they fired both of us. \\n\\nThe fun started when I got really drunk and we decided to buy some ice. I asked him to give me some because I was drunk and wanted to try it and he complied. I was addicted to the rush and had fun with it at first but it got old because we couldn't sleep and we started getting paranoid. Then we would miss the clinic and he told me he needed dope. Now I know he was bullshitting me but I didn't know, I felt bad for him. \\n\\nEventually, I started to do it. Then we ran out of money, cuz no job and paying $15 a day. We were getting dope by getting points for our dboy and giving him rides wherever he needed to go, selling off our shit, lying to our friends and family what we needed the money for until we exhausted all of our options. Eventually, we were both using every day until a few days ago. We had nothing, negative money in the account, burned bridges, no dope, no methadone, no food or gas money, no weed, smokes or beer to take the edge off. \\n\\nThen withdrawal hit and holy hell. I had been through alcohol withdrawal and I know it can kill you but goddamn the withdrawal from dope was one of the most painful things I've experienced. I hit rock bottom. This guy doesn't love me, I know that but I'm glad he was there for me. He just held me in his arms while I shook and tremored and felt like I was dying. My bones hurt so bad I couldn't hold still. We just lied there in silence, other than my groans of pain, and I looked up in my dim room wondering what the fuck happened. How if I just died right then everything would be okay, well, for me. I had no prospects for the future and owe an ungodly amount of money and apologies to my friends and family. I hated my life and how I was so fucking stupid to put myself through this shit and how I let the man next to me down. I was supposed to help him and instead, I enabled him and used him, let him use me. \\n\\nIt's day 4 of being almost completely sober, took tylenol and vaped some tobacco, and I feel positive. Time to dig myself out of this mess. Not sure why I feel this unprecedented euphoria and positivity but I'm gonna take it and run with it. I don't really have any words of wisdom or encouragement for you guys but just knowing I won't be judged for talking about this gives me comfort. I barely had a taste of that life and now know I don't want to live that way, I can see it getting so much worse. I've seen how our dboy lives and read stories on here of withdrawing in prison. Maybe I'm a little bitch for typing this out but whatever, we all have our own paths. I was miserable unless I was watching him cook up the dope for us. Now I look forward to seeing the beauty life has to offer again and maybe this time, without the alcohol. \\n\\nThanks for reading.", "2_timestamp": "2018-02-13 01:14:55", "comments": [{"6hell6boy6": [{"du69v0h": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-02-13 04:17:15", "1_text": "Im thinking about you.

And every time i start using again my life gets progressively worse.  \\n\\nLike i said just always remember this pain you are going through, and when your brain tries to get you to do some dope, remind it that you dont want to go back to your lowest point. \\n\\nI get what you are saying that you are in the rut of your life.

I know that for sure. \\n\\nWhen I was in Canada a few years ago CDN 80s were readily available which were exactly like OG (OC) 80s but they said CDN 80 on them instead of OC 80. IIRC they looked exactly the same, and were the same in pretty much every way. Not sure if Canada still produces those though, unlikely EU which I know for a fact does. Pretty crazy to think.\\n\\nAlso in Europe, from what I've heard, there is basically no in between from codeine to oxy. In USA the ladder for prescribing is usually codeine (like T3s) then vicodin then oxy (percocet or whatever). As far as I know they don't prescribe hydrocodone at ALL in Europe, not even sure if it exists there in legal form. So you see way more codeine (which is also OTC in EU in most places as far as I know in some capacity) and you see way more oxy. \\n\\nTake this with a grain of salt as I do not personally live in EU, just from what I've seen and heard from friends who live there etc. Sorry for the long post, time for me to go to fucking sleep lol.

Life here lately has just enjoyed throwing bullshit my way and I haven\u2019t been able to catch a break. Haven\u2019t been sick or anything, so that\u2019s a good thing. Kept getting the run around on a lot of things, but what\u2019s new. Anyways, this couple that my girl knows needed a ride to go pick up. Unless it\u2019s worth my time I don\u2019t fuck around with shit like that since it seems like I\u2019m the only one around the area that still has a car and hasn\u2019t sold it for drugs or some shit like that. Back to the couple. They said it would be worth my time and made sure it was going to be. Was still skeptical cause I\u2019ve heard that before and it wasn\u2019t, figured if it was something like that again, I\u2019d just kick em out of my car. For one, it was midnight, going through smaller towns and then hitting back roads. Sketches me out cause cops are dicks and think if you\u2019re out that late, your up to no good. Long story short, split 3 30s between 4 of us. Haven\u2019t had anything but .5mg of a sub 28hrs before that. Got first pull and split it with my girl. Did the shot and waited....and waited and waited. Didn\u2019t feel a damn thing. Other couple didn\u2019t feel a damn thing either. Figured at least ONE of us would have felt a little something. Got to lookin at the other 3 pills and they were m box 30s. Wellllll, that shit was fake as fuck! Still wondering what the fuck I shot up. Obviously wasn\u2019t something horrible cause we\u2019re all still fine. Very first time I\u2019ve ever come across a pressed pill, around my area. Its not common whatsoever here cause a lot of people haven\u2019t even heard of presses and shit like that. Like I\u2019ve said in previous posts, live around a bunch of redneck tweakers. Basically a shit post but just still in shock. The guy tasted one after we all realized it wasn\u2019t what it was supposed to be and he said it wasn\u2019t bitter at all. I guess it wasn\u2019t too bad cause I got another 8mg sub strip for $10 from a buddy I went to way earlier in the day for rox 20s but ended up being phenfrazine or some shit like that. Wasn\u2019t his fault since he doesn\u2019t dabble in this game much but he felt bad for me coming and not getting what I was hoping to get and felt compelled to find me something. So yeah, this weekend was basically total shit except for not being sick, which I\u2019m thankful for but cheese and rice this was some shitty bullshit.

I told them I could start next Monday but they said they needed the position to be filled ASAP and wanted me to come in Thursday, Friday and Saturday for training/regular work, 8 hours each day. I wasn't expecting anything so soon because I wanted to take this week to detox and start straight for work next week. However, being that I can't really leverage when I can start, if I accept the job, I'll be in for a rude awakening by Thursday/Friday with withdrawals.

I\u2019m not really into NA or AA at all, but CoDa is probably one of the coolest/satisfying meetings I\u2019ve ever been to. It really cuts out all the AA bullshit, and gets straight to the root of our issues as addicts that have been ingrained in us since childhood, and explains why/how we are in life with relationships, and everything in between.

I\u2019m sorry watching you overdose on our anniversary ruined me. I\u2019m sorry it ruined you. I\u2019m sorry this is so scary for me and for you. I\u2019m sorry for everything. I\u2019m sorry this has turned me into a bitch. I\u2019m sorry that I hate you when you\u2019re high. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t stand this relationship anymore. I\u2019m sorry I tried for so long and I\u2019m sorry you probably feel like I\u2019m giving up on you. I\u2019m sorry that I couldn\u2019t do more to help you. I\u2019m so fucking sorry that I couldn\u2019t do more. If I could give you the world I would. I\u2019d give you everything if I knew it wouldn\u2019t kill you. I\u2019m sorry I want you to live so badly. I\u2019m sorry that you have to play Russian roulette with yourself multiple times a day. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how scary this is for you. But it\u2019s so scary for me too. \\n\\nI can\u2019t wake up every morning wondering if when I walk into our living room if you\u2019re going to be alive. I\u2019m sorry that I make you shower with the door open. Im sorry that I\u2019m so worried about everything you\u2019re doing and if you\u2019re okay warm fed and safe. Im sorry I\u2019m overprotective. I\u2019m sorry I just want my best friend back. I can\u2019t keep cleaning up your vomit in the bathroom or your blood on the counters from your needles. The tape you leave everywhere from your bags. The tiny pieces of paper. \\n\\nI just want my best friend back more than anything. I\u2019d give anything for our tickle fights again. For normal sex. For you to be able to finish again. To see you smile genuinely. For you not to be sad or depressed. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019ve had to steal for this. For you to break your family\u2019s trust and hearts. I\u2019m sorry you feel like you have to hide your life. I\u2019m sorry you have to go through this. I\u2019m so sorry for you. I love you more than fucking anything and I just want you to be okay. \\n\\nTwo different worlds and minds so far from each other. I\u2019ve never tried a single drug and you\u2019ve experienced them all. I\u2019m just tired of crying myself to sleep at night terrified of the next day for you. This isn\u2019t healthy for either of us and I know I\u2019ve told you that a million times. And I\u2019m sorry for repeating myself again. I just want normalcy and simplicity. I just want you to go to na or rehab again or try to even want to get better again, again. I want you to want to get better more than anything my love. I really do. \\n\\nI hope you do. And I hope you get to grow your hair out like you want and that you get to get more tattoos. I hope you get to buy the new electronics that you want. Some new shoes and games. I hope, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. I hope you can find God or something and want to get better. I hope you do get better. I hope someone loves you so hard like we did. I hope she gives you the world. I hope we meet in another life and we can try this again. Make the babies we always said we\u2019d have, grow old together, have grandchildren. Get puppies and another cat. A huge house for all of these new lives. Cars and amazing jobs. I love you. And I always fucking will.

Thought you guys would like to read while it's still fresh in my memory.\\n\\n\\nIt all starts at an unfamiliar house. A bunch of chicks are upstairs getting costumes on for some Halloween party. They invite me and offer me a costume, I refuse. I leave the house and drive for a while, park on the street in some faceless city and start walking.. I see a blonde haired, skinny dude walk out of a building. He's bobbing his head as if he's listening to music. I follow him. He reaches into his pocket for his phone and out drops a colorful mix of baggies onto the ground. He keeps walking. I pick up the bags and catch up to him, tap on his shoulder. He mutters something without looking at me and continues to dance down the street. I put the bags in my pocket to investigate later. I return to the building he came from and open the door. It's an elevator.\\n\\nThe buttons go in order of 1, 4, 5, 7. I press 1. The doors close slowly but then the elevator starts to rush downward, then sideways, then upward, then downward again.. Finally the door opens. I scramble out into a dark hall of elevators to be met by ghoulish creature. It looks like a thousand-eyed woman-centaur on a grasshopper's body. The walls are a dark, dried-blood red. The creature has a clipboard. She asks if I'm lost. I tell her I just want to go back home. She says I need to go to the first floor. I tell her that's the button I pushed. She says to try the \"F\" button. I'm nervous. I go back into the elevator and press the \"F\" and close my eyes. The elevator sways like a goddamn ship, then the door opens. I'm in a dimly lit bar that only serves coffee. Everyone stops what they're doing and looks at me. The bartender is another one of those freaky cricket-ladies. She asks me if I'm lost. I tell her yes. She asks if I'd like a coffee. I refuse and go back to the elevator. I press \"5.\" Fucking roller coaster this time. The door opens and I'm on a grassy knoll in the middle of a sunny park. The elevator stands alone in the middle of the field awkwardly but I think nothing of it. I start walking. Time to check out those bags I scored on the ground! Fuck yeah - They're fat and full of dope! I need to find somewhere to do them. I start walking faster along a path into the woods. A group of guys spot me. It's the dancing dude that dropped his bags and his twin brother. They start questioning me. One of them trips me. I scramble to get away. Fuck, now I'm not going to get to do this bag!

I never took it cause i didn't have diarrhea.. If i only knew!  Edit: might actually be addictive if used long-term. Do research on this first cause I'm truly not sure \\n\\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loperamide\\n\\n- Hot baths. Will help aches, pains and RLS. at times this was the only thing that helped. Spend the day in the tub if you have to. \\n\\n- Kratom. Legal opiates that you can use to wean yourself with. I liked mixing with applesauce\\n\\n- there's a dosing/tapering schedule that uses half-life of the opiate to make the taper less painful and more successful. I'll edit it in if I can\\n\\n- look up 'the thomas recipe for opiate withdrawal'. It's pretty famous, if you haven't heard of it yet, check it out. What the hell I'll post it below. It's somewhat helpful\\n\\n>\\nThomas Recipe\\n\\nTaper your opiate dose as much as you can before hand, and if possible take some time off from work or any other obligations you might have.\\n\\nWhat you need:\\n\\nValium or any other type of benzodiazepine like Ativan, Klonopin, Xanax etc. Immodiun. L-Tyrosine. Mineral supplement that contains at least 100% RDA of Zinc, Phosphorus, Copper, Magnesium and Potassium. You may not find a supplement that contains all of these together. If not, then buy separately. Vitamin B6. Access to hot showers or baths.\\n\\nPutting it all into action:\\n\\n\u201cStart the vitamin/mineral supplement right away (or the first day you can keep it down), preferably with food. Potassium early in the detox is important to help relieve RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome). Bananas are a good source of potassium if you can\u2019t find a supplement for it.\\n\\nBegin your detox with regular doses of Valium (or alternate benzo). Start with a dose high enough to produce sleep. Before you use any benzo, make sure you\u2019re aware of how often it can be safely taken. Different benzos have different dosing schedules. Taper your Valium dosage down after each day. The goal is to get through day 4, after which the worst WD symptoms will subside. You shouldn\u2019t need the Valium after day 4 or 5.\\n\\nDuring detox, hit the hot bath or Jacuzzi as often as you need to for muscle aches. Don\u2019t underestimate the effectiveness of hot soaks. Spend the entire time, if necessary, in a hot bath. This simple method will alleviate what is for many the worst opiate WD symptom.\\n\\nUse the Imodium aggressively to stop the runs. Take as much as you need, as often as you need it. Don\u2019t take it, however, if you don\u2019t need it.\\n\\nAt the end of the fourth day, you should be waking up from the Valium and experiencing the beginnings of the opiate WD malaise. Upon rising (empty stomach), take the L-Tyrosine. Try 2000 mgs, and scale up or down, depending on how you feel. You can take up to 4,000 mgs. Take the L-Tyrosine with B6 to help absorption. Wait about one hour before eating breakfast. The L-Tyrosine will give you a surge of physical and mental energy that will help counteract the malaise. You may continue to take it each morning for as long as it helps. If you find it gives you the \u201ccoffee jitters,\u201d consider lowering the dosage or discontinuing it altogether. Occasionally, L-Tyrosine can cause the runs. Unlike the runs from opiate WD, however, this effect of L-Tyrosine is mild and normally does not return after the first hour. Lowering the dosage may help.\\n\\nContinue to take the vitamin/mineral supplement with breakfast.\\n\\nAs soon as you can force yourself to, get some mild exercise such as walking, cycling, swimming, etc. This will be hard at first, but will make you feel considerably better.\\n>\\n\\n"}], "du6wggv": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-02-13 12:17:59", "1_text": "If a weighted blanket helps, compression socks would probably help.

The most important thing to know is to research customs and laws if you are traveling outside the country. I can\u2019t stress this enough. I had a terrifying experience at Canadian customs, and I had NOTHING on me. No paraphernalia, nothing. They held me for hours just because I guess I look a little \u201calternative.\u201d If they had found anything at all I would\u2019ve been strip searched. They went through every pill bottle (all scripted and legit), every article of clothing, every item at least twice. It was horrible.\\n\\nAnd I\u2019ve heard other countries in the Middle East and Asia can be really hardcore with this kind of enforcement as well, not to mention the consequences. So pick somewhere safe.\\n\\nThat said, I never had an issue traveling domestically with any kind of pills. Just put em in a prescription bottle with your name on it or an otc med bottle. I had no problem carrying methadone either - I\u2019d put it right on the top of my carry on in a ziplock. \\n\\nFor domestic flights or flights to doable countries I\u2019d use the lady pocketbook for dope, and put my rigs carefully tucked away and concealed in a toiletry bag in my checked bag. You don\u2019t ever want needles in carry on. Despite TSA tearing thru my checked bags over and over they left my works alone. I would store them with diabetic supplies in the bag though. It\u2019s still really tricky and probably not super smart to fly intl with works.\\n\\nSo yeah, do your homework, calculate what risks you are taking and then just be careful.\\n\\nAlso this is kind of fucked up, but one of my favorite things to do was to go to big dope cities and cold cop.

I have been an alcoholic for 7 years. By alcoholic I mean if I don't drink I'm shaking and on the verge of having a seizure. The first time I stopped drinking cold turkey for a few months I picked up a pill habit. \\n\\nIt started as getting a few once a month which evolved into every two weeks when my guy got his script. That slowly evolved into me being able to get pills anytime I want. All the while I was ever conscious as to what was actually taking place here, I was trading one addiction for another although now I'm working towards being a junky instead of a highly functioning alcoholic. \\n\\nMy point being is I knew what the possible outcome was of my situation. Not only did I know but I didn't give two fucks less either as I was on the downslope. I never romanticized alcohol like I did with pills and I was about as hardcore of an alco as they come. When I was starting to get low on funds I never plotted from sun up to sun down on a way to get more liquor I just accepted my fate as what it was. Speaking from both sides of the fence, opiates wont kill you during withdrawal, alcohol will. I went through alcohol withdrawal yet my mind wont let me go without pills. With alcohol I seen my downward spiral and I was aware and took action against it. With opiates I am also aware of my downward spiral yet I could give two fucks less and in a way am ever so welcoming of the fact I'm gonna sniff 4 30's tonight, tomorrow and however long I manage to keep scrapping up money.\\n\\nMoral of the story is you think you are in control but you are not. My prior addiction could kill me if I didn't have my fix, this one wont. I never even thought about spending my electric bill or cable bill money on liquor and beer. Ask me that now? I will tell you how I can get an extension and hustle up a few bucks to pay it off eventually as long as I get my opiates I'm good, and the worst part is I'm perfectly ok with it. \\n"}]}], "ZeusCarver00": [{"du6tueo": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-02-13 11:38:36", "1_text": "If you were going to buy off the DNMs then go for European oxy vendors, I don't know if your from the US or EU but you won't get ripped with them or some fent bullshit, not encouraging you to do that but just some safe advice if you don't want fent, or just not buy any at all, be safe!"}], "du7jr1s": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-02-13 18:32:36", "1_text": "Yeah definitely your right in it being more risky but wouldn't you not rather to get it seized than to get dodgy shit at home?

People are selling fake pills or fake heroin made with this substance. It is very potent and if it is not mixed accurately it creates hot spots where on pill or on flake of powder has much more in it. So they get a dose and didn't expect so much. Black out and die.\\n\\nYou mention concentrations OP and that is another big problem. Since heroin is illegal there is no oversight in it's production. Every single batch is different in one way or another. Potency of some heroin may be as low as 4%, to where high quality can be 80%+. So a .3 shot of one is good where the other that may kill you.\\n\\nAnother big reason is rehab. People quit, get totally clean and then relapse. They haven't done it in so long they don't have the same tolerance and do a similar amount to what they were doing when they stopped. Lost a friend to that. ( Edit to clarify dosage: A new user or one with no tolerance may get a good effect from .05g if it is potent enough. A habitual user may be using .5g in a shot and doing that multiple times in a day. Tolerance is a weird thing thing and it takes huge amounts of heroin or other opiod to maintain someone in active addiction)\\n\\nStandardized doses would save so many lives. Overdoses are going to increase in the US as they try to clamp further on opiods.

It's an alternative to blowing their brains out. Remember suicidal people don't want to end their life, they want to end their pain and that's precisely what Opiates do. People with lots of emotional pain lack endorphins and Dopamine. They rather give you a bunch of anti-depressants that don't work. Some countries in Europe are studying things like Subutex and Methadone for depression and anxiety, short term use. All anti-depressants should be short term used or as-needed. Even SNRIs will cause severe withdrawal after only 2 weeks of using everyday. Brain zaps, seizures and all that. I find that Opiates work much better for anxiety than Benzos do. Benzos just make me tired and anhedonic. \\n\\nAnd you're right about the Tylenol, they sell something that easily causes Liver damage yet they want to start trying to control Imodium. Maybe if they legalized Opiates and had them easy to get people wouldn't have to turn to street drugs. If Heroin were as cheap as booze addicts wouldn't have to sell all their stuff to fund their habit because the prices would be reasonable.\\n\\nWe are grown men, adults.

Imagine your worst episodes of depression,mash them all together at once, now that\u2019s how I feel when I\u2019m coming down off of a high that I paid to have for an hour to four (since that\u2019s as long as it last till you have to dose once again) and I won\u2019t have anyway to cop my supply needed to get me through the work day let alone the whole day. Then I lay awake all night pondering ,scheming in my brain as I obsess about how I\u2019m going to be fully sick all day,how I can scratch together a few dollars,change,what I can sell that\u2019s worth some $ to cop again, all while I\u2019m beating myself up for putting myself in this position...\\n\\nAlarm for work goes off and I\u2019m lucky to of had 1-2 hours of shitty sleep. Leave for work early so I can roam the streets of one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the country praying the dboys are giving out samples of their new batch of H (usually the samples are the most dangerous bags since they put the highest content of fentanyl in them to make them really strong so you of course come back for more because it\u2019s deceivingly strong), best case scenario I\u2019m able to get a sample, go to work, get \u201cwell\u201d and hopefully don\u2019t od, vomit, nod out, etc I\u2019m front of a boss/co-worker for obvious reasons like loosing my job, hurt myself or someone else.  While driving from job to job hopping when I nod it\u2019s at a red light or stop sign and not while driving and t-bone, side swipe, rear end an innocent person in their car (god forbid I run over a child walking across the street heading to school),.. this is all within the first few hours of the morning! While at work I have to come up with a plan on how to get more for after work since I\u2019ll be sick once lunch time hits. Leave work and find scrap metal, something of the wife\u2019s that she won\u2019t realistically missing for quite sometime and go pawn it for peanuts compared to what it\u2019s worth since you can physically see I\u2019m a junkie that needs a bag and will take any amount just for the next one. Now I manage to be able to buy a few bags that should last me a day or two right? \u201cWrong\u201d because that dope I had before was way stronger because it was a sample right. So I wind up doing double from what I did before work to get high. Now I get home, eat dinner that my wonderful wife made me, after that it\u2019s right back to wing majorly depressed/obsessing how, and what I can do for another tiny lil bag that runs my life! \\n\\nNow just an FYI the story I shared is a good day for a junkies like myself because I didn\u2019t go all day without any dope. Story would be way different if I couldn\u2019t cop to get well at least once through the day. It\u2019s just a tiny glimpse into my world of me \u201cthe junkie\u201d... imagine constant anxiety,depression,  numerous other feelings just because you don\u2019t have any dope or can\u2019t get any. Imagine the scary/crazy situations we put ourselves in because we rob,cheat and steal for $ at times. We travel around in the worst area/neighborhoods to get dope most of the time. Literally I copped dope on one corner Sunday night from a corner I go to all the time and when I went to cop Monday there was about 100 candles lit on that same corner with a  a mural painted of a child/father that were gunned down after I copped Sunday night because of drug dealers shooting at each other. The concrete was still stained in blood!!! And the drug dealers were still right there selling dope! Talk about insanity man well that\u2019s what it is live and up close...\\n\\nVery small glimpse into a fiends life! Not everyone is like this but many junkies lie myself are! Make the right decision and stay far far away if you don\u2019t want this life! Have a blessed day. And I\u2019ll be heading to that corner by 520 to cop actually after i get ready to leave for work.

You can go from sad to bargaining to denial right back to sad and then acceptance and then anger all over again.\\n4. Healing takes time. Pamper yourself, be gentle and kind to yourself and do what you need to do to feel well. For me that involved taking time off school and addressing my issues in a serious way.\\n\\nWe can talk more at length about the process but right now just be kind, easy and non-critical of yourself.

I've changed about 10 therapists and I know that it's not about \"finding the right one\". I cannot be fixed. I've been going to different psychologists, psychiatrists and therapists. I've been on Xanax for years. My psych basically experimented with me: he tried on me so many pills that I've lost the count - Rivotril, Prozac, Escitalopram, Adderal, Zoloft and Hydroxyzine being just a few. Xanax is the only one that's keeping me alive. Zoloft made me psychotic and I almost stabbed my roommates and jumped off a roof. The others only made me feel worse. Therapy and counselling hasn't helped a tiny bit either. In fact, they made me feel kinda worse, because I was trying my best but I could not see any results. I am so jealous of people who can snap out of this terrible place with therapy. Also, \"professionals\" in my country don't know shit about mental illness. The only mental illness they've heard of is depression, and no matter what your symptoms are, they'll give you treatments for depression since it's the only thing they know. The most severe aspect of my BPD is the depersonalization/derealization which makes me feel unreal, unable to recognize voices, unable to recognize myself in the mirror, I cannot feel like I have a sense of self and I literally dissociate 24/7. When I tried to talk to my psychiatrists about derealization, they knew nothing about it. The only relief I got was from one single therapist who diagnosed me with BPD and OCD (he was the ONLY professional in 10 who actually knew about mental disorders other than depression) and talking with foreign volunteer psychs about my symptoms. So why do I even bother?\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nI think I'm tired of this shit called life. I have two choices: start doing drugs or kill myself. I know I might sound overly dramatic, but I can't cope with the chronic pain anymore. I know it's stupid. But being in constant pain isn't any better either, is it? If I don't do something quick, I'll end up killing myself in less than 3 months because I can't cope anymore. My rose-colored glasses were shattered a long time ago and I can no longer see life the same way or basically enjoy anything in life, like hobbies, music or relationships. So what if the heroin is going to fuck me up? Like I'm not already fucked up, lol. Whatever I do, I'm still going to die. I'll die either by suicide or overdose, in case I start doing drugs. But with H, I'd probably manage to make the last few weeks/months of my life less painful.\\n\\nSince I know the rules don't allow posting locations or names, I'm going to be very blunt: how do you find your dealers? How do you not get caught and jailed? I literally don't know where to go or what to begin with. Where and how did you find your first dealer? I really need your help since I'm new to this and I feel so lost.", "2_timestamp": "2018-02-14 16:00:53", "comments": [{"Dammit234": [{"du8f78q": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-02-14 08:13:18", "1_text": "I\u2019ll be the first of many responders to tell you that no matter what, heroin is not the answer to your questions and problems.

There will still be withdrawals with a quick taper but it won\u2019t be nearly as severe.\\nIn my first treatment I did a similar fashion, 16 mg first 3 days then 8 mg for a week then 6 and so on. Got on and off subs within a month and it made the withdrawal a lot less severe, I came into the treatment 2 days sober and I was laying on the floor puking and the nurse is like get this boy some suboxone lol."}]}]}]}]}
