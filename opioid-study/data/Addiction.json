Im just out of a relationship with a kid that wasn't mine, we were together 4 years and she was bipolar. It honestly got to the point where i would get drunk to deal with her, on top of that there were painkillers, valium, cocaine and alcohol. This was all because of a failing relationship that neither of us could come to terms with or as i blame myself for not having the balls to end it sooner cause it was toxic to both of us and most importantly the kid. We wouldn't do anything in front of the kid or anything but us being out of it didn't really help much with anything. \n\nIm talking about myself to much.. your feeling unwanted by your boyfriend and you seem stuck in a rutt, dont do what i did and use drugs to try regain the feelings you once had for each other. Honesty is the best policy ask him straight up if your not doing it for him anymore or do you not find me attractive. The two possibilities that i can imagine is he feels the relationship is stale and/or not going anywhere (this is good because it can be fixed with an honest chat to each other, just say how you feel instead of bottling shit up honestly it might be hard but its the best course of action) or the worse option the relationship is past the point of saving and trying to save it will only hurt you both and someone needs to break it off..\n\nApologies for the essay but you asked for honesty and that what you got, keep your chin up though.

I didn't go through quite the same control stuff you are talking about but it was more subtle stuff like not bringing in enough money. Saying that i did have a knife pulled on me by her during a manic stage, not that thats her fault but the relationship as a whole was toxic and i got stuck in a cycle of self blame and filled that with cocaine and alcohol mainly, among other things. \n\nYou mentioned self harm... unfortunately thats another thing i can empathize about. A week after the break up I get a phone call from her saying something i couldn't understand and then phonecall from her mum saying she'd tried to kill herself with a concoction of pills and vodka... I couldn't deal with the feelings of blame that brought on so I got completely fucked that night cocaine alcohol and valium and attempted to cut my vein that goes across my pec muscle. I thought id succeeded with the amount of blood coming out and went and passed out. Lucky me I woke up with a series of cuts and slices, one was so deep i could see a yellow layer of fat millimetres away from where my actual vein was. If id cut that and passed out im sure I wouldn't be here telling you this. Now ive got a horrible mess on my chest that i'll have to explain whenever i take my top off.

I wanted to break a habit that I knew for a long time that slowly kills me and it is unhealthy, not to mention it smells really bad. At the time I knew that I'm  in a decent relationship with alcohol either. It is true what they say: addictions walk hand in hand. I didn't have serious problems with drinking, don't get me wrong, but I knew if I follow the binge-drink with friends path I will end up in  Mount-Doom like Gollum, chasing the one thing that will eventually destroy my whole life and kill me in the end. \n\nSo I woke up on on January the 2nd, with a terrible hangover, without cigarettes and not one beer left from last night. I was wondering and thinking about how can I buy a pack of cigarettes and some beer, when I realized that I'm pathetic. Do you agree? Waking up and the first thing that comes to ones mind are cigarettes and beer - what the hell man? I have a home, a loving family, loving friends a great career opportunity right before me, a whole world to explore and I'm  healthy. And now really... the first thing that I can imagine in the morning is smoking and drinking. After  the drama around the pathetic part has settled, I came to the realization that after all: *this is not the way to live, this is the way to die.* \n\nWhy not quit? \n\nI knew that the commitment to quit will come with a great price... at the time I didn't knew what I will be getting for that price. \nThe first days were horrible, I carved for a cigarette, it was really hard not to drink either. At first I had to make up things so I can avoid going to a pub or restaurant where i can get a beer or two or where I'm tempted to smoke. A little voice in my head kept telling me, it has been X days since you quit, if you smoke one cigarette or drink just one beer you can start the whole thing form the beginning. All binge-drinkers know, that there is no such thing as only one beer for us, we have to drink till our minds are offline. I have downloaded a few apps tracking my wallet and health, and that was enough for the daily motivation and willingness to go on. At first it was a real struggle, but as the days began to pass, I felt more confident and I have slowly exiled my addiction to the dark corners of my mind. \n\nOne year has passed since I cast out those demons from my life. They have taken majority of my friends with them - these friends were friends only when I was drinking so \"F\" them anyway - and my self doubt, anxiety and constant fear of alcoholism, constant fear of cancer and liver disease , and the: \"Jesus what did I do last night\" syndrome.   In change I have gained a career an my life back. As a matter of fact I have a life I didn't know existed:  started to exercise(swimming), I got rid of the guilt and shame originating from drinking,  I'm more respected at work, filtered out my friends(one needs quality not quantity), I can go to a party and have fun without drinking a single drop. I'we got a life that I never imagined. I just began to know myself better and my interests have expanded tremendously, my focus is back, I'm not irritated and offended by every small word. No more hangover washed out face in the mornings.\n\nI'we been sober and drug free for a whole year(even my mouthwash is alcohol free), I could not have achieved this without my friends help and support, special thanks to the Curly one. I'm very thankful to them for believing in me and supporting me along the way. \nI would like to say thanks to those friend whom I left behind for accepting my decisions, and I would like to thank you for reading my story. If you are wondering what will happen if you quit, stop wondering and postponing to next week, next year or whatever. Just do it and don't look back, it is an incredible journey to a better version of yourself. In the end you have to be strong, no one can help you if you don't help yourself. For those who struggle with severe withdrawal syndromes or with severe depression I advise to get help from a qualified person. Remember: You are not alone! Have great 2018!\n\nTL;DR: I have been not drinking and smoking for an entire year, the journey was hard but totally worth it. I gained back my life, my health and made awesome friends.

If i had just lost that initial 3000 I would of still been at rock-bottom and so be it. But I would be devasted if i lost anymore but I cannot stop trading. The first thing i do when i wake up in the morning is check my balance and look at potential moves. I check my balance 20-30 times per day. I know I should stop now but i don't think i can. I made a trade this morning and it started dropping and i immediately sold out. Anyone else addicted to this?

Today started the way last night left off.  Me and my boyfriend went to bed mad at eachother.  He knew I was due for a refill on my meds,  he said if I took too many of my clonidine I would end up killing myself,  me being the asshole I am said \"really? They can kill me\"  and that was all it took.  He took offense to it because his sister has attempted suicide as have I.  What I don't understand is how someone who claims to care so much can talk so much shit.  He constantly puts his sister down and calls me stupid one way or another every chance he gets.  I have an appt for my meds Tuesday and need to have clean urine.  He crushed up more Xanax for me and tried to salvage the day.  He is currently sitting in the bedroom with his brother in law playing video games and I'm left sitting here wondering why I even stay.  I do everything I can for this man,  I have changed so much for him,  to be what he wants me to be.  My issue,  well more of a worry is that once he makes it off parole in April he is going to go right back to drugs and alcohol more than he has in the last couple weeks.  Alcohol and I have a bad past,  alcohol is the reason that every single person who was supposed to love and protect me only hurt and damaged me.  Again today he told me that he doesn't change when he drinks but if I have a problem with him drinking then I need to walk away now.  In a conversation with his sister she told me that in the past when he would drink with his ex they would constantly fight and he was always showing up all bloody and bruised.......   I am going to be 32 this next year and I am past that point in my life,  I don't want to fight and I certainly don't want to be with a man that will put his hands on me.  I guess it has already somewhat started.  He gave me a bunch of Klonopins* (not sure of the spelling)  one night and decided to be an asshole.  I can only be pushed around and called a cunt so many times before I see red and he pushed me to that limit,  he got in my face and the only thing that seemednto be the thing to do was headbutt him.  I ended up knocking out one of his front teeth and cut right above my eye in the process,  he got pissed but cleaned up my face,  I was so fucked up and pissed off I didn't even know I was bleeding.  Then it just went away like nothing happened.  We have had 2 miserable days together.  He got all lovey as we snorted the Xanax and apologized for the last couple days saying we were going to make it right today and not have a day like that again.  So here I sit high as a kite while he sits in the room playing video games.......   What am I supposed to do?  I feel this unnatural obligation to please him and if I were to leave he would tell me again that if I go then that's it...........  Fuck!!!

So that's a third time those had a major negative impact on my life. \n\nAfter that I quit doing drugs to get my license back and also to protect myself and getting shit done. Back then I gathered those I did drugs with but somewhat considered friends anyway and we had an excessive Sylvester party going after which we all stopped, for one it was four weeks until he did drugs again, for the other one it was 4 months but I stayed consequently clean for almost than five years straight. During that time I got an degree from evening school, got a job that I really like.\n\nAt one point when I was driving to meet some friends I got to know when playing games during my recovery from the accident which hurt my leg I even went so far to wonder if I have been put to coma and have been dreaming all of this since my situation back there was so much better than everything I have experienced somewhat conscious before. I even got the relation with my parents somewhat fixed, after threatening my father with a knife when I was high at the age of 16. \n\nSo I felt very proud of myself, especially since one of the guys from back then hops his jobs every few months and the other one has just been released from jail after being imprisoned for crimes he committed to fund his substance abuse.\n\nA few months back I already had an relapse after meeting one guy I regularly hung out with when doing drugs when going to a bar on a friend's birthday. But when hiding in the city do snort a guy came by who just has been cheated on by the wife he had a child with. He was a hard working man who did not just finance his family but also his wife's degree course. But when he came home from work his wife was being fucked on their appartement's balcony. When he rushed up to their appartement the guy jumped off the fifth floor, when he went out he couldn't feel any pulse on him so he left the scene when he heard sirens close to the building.\n\nWe've been talking for almost three hours and when he was about to leave he honestly thanked me just to have talked to him since he was sure his friends wouldn't understand that he was honestly loving his wife and child and was so devastated to find out she was cheating on him. I'm sure that I wouldn't have talked to him to such an extent when I would have been sober at that point, so I could justify it to myself by improving that poor guy's situation mostly by listening to him. During the conversation I used up everything my acquaintance handed over to me.\n\nBut on this Sylvester evening I was on a party and did Amphetamines again, again for no reason but his time I was somewhat sober alcohol wise and not being able to justify it to myself by any means. I'm kind of put down by this since I can't blend this out so it's my second relapse in just a few months and I'm afraid that it will happen in shorter intervals or negatively influence my life again, for example when my mom asked me to drive her to the doctor tomorrow since she got blind on one eye shortly before Christmas and I can't turn her down without telling her the truth which would probably hurt her so much that I'm afraid to be that honest to her. It's almost as terrifying that I went from being clean for almost five years (I could blend out the relapse when I spoke with that betrayed guy) to just a few weeks since I now think it was a mistake to take that relapse before thoughtless. \n\nSince I know I can't reverse what happened I'm just hoping not to get into trouble during the next few days since I can't avoid leaving the house now which I did before.

My gf (of a little over five years) became addicted to opioids about two years ago. She hid it pretty well from everyone she's close to, including me at first. She told me about it and started suboxone treatment about a year into her addiction. Everything seemed to be going fine, but then in spring of 2017, she lost a sequence of jobs, and started to unravel in general because she was still using despite being on suboxone, and she just wasn't able to \"control\" her habit as well as she once could. Fast forward to August of 2017, drug-related legal trouble is looming, and she entered inpatient rehab, which she completed after about six weeks. I let her move in with me when she got out. She was unpacking her things and found some drugs, which I found her using (found her passed out on the floor of the bathroom)...relapse #1. I confronted her about it, tried to understand, and moved on. She started an intensive outpatient program shortly after as part of her recovery, had been going to meetings, etc., and all seemed good except for the single incident. Then, last week, I discovered some heroin she had purchased from the dark web, which I flushed. She refuses to discuss it. All she'll do is say she \"wasn't thinking straight,\" and her solution was for me to kick her out, putting the onus of dealing with this firmly on me. I also know that she's been purchasing bitcoin as recently as two days ago, which is a huge red flag that she may try again. \n\nOne final detail to note is that she is very resistant to any kind of talk therapy, and my impression based on her recounting of events is she just went through the motions while in rehab. Also fairly sure she has an undiagnosed personality disorder...while not diagnostically 100% borderline personality, she's pretty damn close, and this just complicates things even further. \n\nWhat do I need to do / should I be doing. I'm about at my wit's end, and I'm about to kick her out, but I do have very strong feelings for her (we've been through a lot together and had an overall intensely rocky relationship aside from dealing with her addiction), and I don't want to be the guy who abandoned his girlfriend when she theoretically needs me the most (I realize that letting her stay in my house and my life in general is a kind of enabling behavior, but another complicating factor is that she's completely alienated her family over this despite THEIR best efforts to help her, so I'm all she's got). I know my thinking reeks of codependency, but I can't help feeling the way I do and really need some perspective on the whole mess, as any that I once had is long gone.

I didn't go to a bunch of therapy or get on medications to stop the obsessive and manic behaviors. I found what really helped me was tackling the worst of the problems first, which was opiates, then belemia, then face picking. Once I got a handle on opiates I found other things to fill my time. I eventually had a kid which takes up 100% of my time. \n\nI pretty much kept myself busy all the time and forgot about the picking and pulling. I won't lie to you, every once in a while like once every four months I get the urge to pick at my face after looking in the mirror or feeling my face. I do have a picking session but I set a timer for 30 minutes and when the time is up I stop. The thing that gets me to stop is the pride of knowing I have control over myself. I also try not to focus on one specific area as not to get any more scars. \n\nYou can do it. It never really disappears, it's still there..  But now it's a whisper. As long as you can accept that it never goes away, you can get control over it.

Khantzian's psychodynamic approach takes into consideration all of the major theories of addiction that have cropped up over the past century, with a practical eye towards treatment implications. \n\nThe book is not geared towards the layperson; it is thorough and scientific and frequently refers to theories and developments under the assumption that the reader has at least a bit of background knowledge in the worlds of substance abuse, psychiatry, psychotherapy, and psychoanalysis (among other subjects). \n\nNevertheless, the best part of this work is that it remains entirely accessible; rather than making the book esoteric, Khantzian's references to more complex subjects serve as wonderful springboards into further research and understanding. \n\nThe book is broken down into various papers that Khantzian and colleagues have published, each of which contains fascinating case studies, as well as copious references to other relevant works and findings. The book remains true to its title: though it delves into the theoretical, Khantzian never strays from his core aim of treating addiction and those who suffer from it with humanity and compassion. \n\nI am a recovering addict with a passionate interest in all things substance abuse-related. For a number of years I saw an addiction psychiatrist and, early on in our time together, I spotted this book on his shelf. I purchased it on a whim, and am glad I did. \n\n\n**For emotional understanding:** *The Lost Weekend* by Charles Jackson \n\n\nThis novel, published in 1944, follows a few days in the life of an alcoholic, and it remains the most truthful and wrenching chronicle of addiction I've ever experienced. Billy Wilder directed its award-winning film adaptation. If you've ever experienced alcoholism or addiction in general, this book will hit home hard. For those who haven't experienced it, it offers a valuable and sympathetic window into the nature of this much-maligned illness."}]}], "elisecapeace": [{"ds74nfv": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-01-04 16:16:21", "1_text": "Recover! by Stanton Peele\n"}]}], "luckycatsweaters": [{"ds7gk4n": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-01-04 20:04:24", "1_text": "Not necessarily about addiction, but about addictive substances.

When I made my life changes I was ready. I was physically and mentally exhausted to the point where I was over the personal benefits of my addiction and ready to change my life. Be sure you have a support system in place whether it is group therapy, family, SO, physicians, workout group or other. I find that it is extremely helpful to surround yourself with others who you can relate with or are like-minded. Set small goals at first like just being generally healthy and work your way to more specified goals. Get rid of objects and thoughts that don\u2019t support or encourage your sobriety. I quit multiple addictions at once and I couldn\u2019t have done it without my doctors, husband, and group therapy. Remember that it is a process and just take it one day at a time.

It's hard because others who haven't gone through it can't really understand just the sheer mental agony addiction can be. You can watch yourself tear yourself and others apart, and it kills you inside and you hate that it's happening, but you just feel like you're in observer mode watching a really sad fucked up movie. Especially meth bro. Especially fucking meth. Meth is something that'll stick with you for life. It's really a curse. I've written and deleted several paragraphs now because I keep rambling so I'll try to do my best to explain shit. From my own experience what has helped me the most is situations where I was somewhat forced to get/stay clean (jail,rehab,court) but that's obvious aha. When trying to just get clean for yourself and others and shit what helped me the most and what I've seen help the most is like finding a reason. For me when I do my best with achieving and maintaining sobriety is when I have other people in my life that I know I have to get clean for. I mean I've been to several rehabs I've lost so much and hurt so many people and it's all killed me so much inside, but most the time even that's not enough. There's just gotta be some sort of click or snap in your mind to where you actually start forcing yourself to get stable. Genuine love care and support are all huge and help so so so so much. Being critical and judgemental, harsh or rude hardly ever helps. Personally that \"tough love\"shit never did help. But also when people sorta cared like too extremely didn't help either. All an addict really could ask for is someone who will always have their back. Someone they know will always love them and be there for them no matter what. I mean cold turkey seems so perfect, but in reality for  most(not all) addicts cold turkey is just not a thing. Especially with meth addiction bro, because meth addiction is sooooo heavily ingrained in your brain. It's not as physically difficult compared to opiates or benzos, but fuck it's mentally the most difficult thing I could imagine having to go through. I really couldn't picture much of anything being so fucking difficult to handle mentally. I can think about times I've shot up for a bit and even thinking of it makes my arms hurt and burn, sends shivers down my spine, and makes me just feel wack. Most addicts are gonna slip, but not every slip means a fall, and even if it is a fall, fall never has to mean the end. Slips are like little binges, falling off is like a total relapse and fuck up for a while till you can get back on track. And I mean even than I've felt that I was at the end quite a few times, but I'm here today to reply to this now ain't I? So much of it is all in the head. So the biggest thing is helping that person do shit to take their mind off of it. You gotta replace an addiction with another \"addiction\". You're just swapping one habit for another one. For example I never used to ever read, but after my third rehab I just started to read tons and it helped a lot. Music has been huge for me, just finding things to do like picking up an instrument or just teaching yourself something. My all time two most helpful coping skills for me personally have been journaling/writing and working out. Physically writing has been a godsend! It gives me a comfortable space in which I can attempt to express myself and try to sort out the mess in my head on the page. Working out also I feel like has saved me a lot. It sounds ridiculous but after I got home for the first time after going on the run for several months I would sit in my room and do pushups and sit ups till I felt like I couldn't move. I'd run and run and run until I felt sick and I couldn't take another step. I would just push myself as far as I could go physically, than try and push myself a bit further after that. At first it just helps since if you're to tired/ sore to move than you probably aren't gonna get high. Also it helped a lot with like phantom pains in my arms from shooting up. I'm very sorry for all of the rambling, I low-key am slightly high as I type this. So yeah bro not gonna lie it's the hardest damn thing, but I've been able to get clean and stay clean before. I've also seen a few of my friends get themselves out of the bullshit. With you and your brother I wouldn't stress to much. I know it's hard, but all you can really do is love your brother forever and always no matter what. You can try and help him do things to take his mind off of it, and just idk be there for him and do your best to trust that even if he messes up that eventually he'll get the hang of it. It takes a whole lot of fuck ups until you learn exactly how to keep your shit straight your own way. I'm sure he can do it, meth addiction is a curse, but there ain't a curse in the world that can't be lifted (': much love though homie message me if you'd like to talk more or need anything or just ask I'm more than happy to try and help out however I can \ud83d\udc96"}], "dskpiar": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-01-12 09:53:37", "1_text": "Yeah of course!

also lazy and sometimes dissasociates with everything around him and numbs himself in addictions.\nWhich addiction may you ask?\n1.Gambling degenerate (since 12 years old)\nOh,there's been some really tough times ,like having money for the week (45$) and in 2-3 hours ,left with only close to 9$ for all my living expenses,full of excuses and bullshit i always got through,full of debts and crying myself at night .I have lots of stories and i will post them as time goes by,for therapy.\n2.Smoking (since 17 years old)\nThe ideea of smoking never appealed to me until i saw one of my relatives,who's the nicest,smartest girl i know take a drag out of a cigarette.I thought *pff,if SHE does that ,then there's nothing wrong with me trying this stuff out*.Fast forward to me battling this addiction over the years,hating myself for it and searching for that dopamine spike again and again.\n3.PMO\nThis is something that always dragged me behind.Staying and losing all my energy to feel lethargic,going on on days on end,week after week,month afther month not accomplishing what i wanted to do.Also my mind dwelved into some pretty dark corners with some fetishes but i'm keeping them at bay trying to become sentisized again.\n4.Food\nBack in HS i used to go to the gym ,take care of my self,and feel like a million bucks.Now i'm close to 200 pounds at 6 feet 1,it's not that bad but i don't feel good ,i am overweight and not pleased with myself.\n5.Internet and games \nAnything that can numb me and make me not to think ,i craved it.Didn't have a great childhood ,dad missed alot of it and when he was part of it,it wasn't nice.I guess i keep trying to fill that void by doing all this stupid shit.\nI'm not looking for sympathy by writing this ,i'm not that misfortunate and i know it but what cuts deeper than losing a friend ,a loved one telling you they don't love you anymore or the absence of a parent ,is the fact that you know you can be great and have all the right tools at hand,but you don't care.That's WASTED POTENTIAL.\nSo,i will keep a tiny journal here,trying to undestand better what addiction is and how i can stop being a slave to dopamine.All these quick fixes that we all crave.All this need to numb ourselves because of the harsh truth of our reality.All the hiding from problems.\nI wish you can all learn something from me and i can learn something

I was on Suboxone for about half a year and the only reason I was able to quit, is Kratom and a good bag o' weed. If you haven't looked into kratom I definitely would. It took away 85% of my WD's and was able to taper down to nothing in a matter of less then a month. I've tried quitting Suboxone many other times as well as heroin before the subs came in and the \"Kratom WD's\" are almost non-existent compared to opiates.

Trying to minimize holidays in early recovery is easiest for me, because much of the reason I used was to make me feel at ease with people around me.

I did start dating pretty quickly after we broke up, I started dating a guy that was also in early recovery.\n\nMy biggest challenge in the dating scene now that I\u2019m in recovery is overcoming the social awkwardness that makes me who I am.

Getting through the first time having sex, first \u201care we in an exclusive relationship\u201d conversation, those kinds of things don\u2019t come naturally to me without drugs or alcohol.

But I've had a harsh realization that my smoking is interfering with my relationship with my wife and daughter. There are a couple other reasons as well, and at the end of the day they're all slightly tied together.\n\nI'm 35 years old. I never believed it was even *possible* to be addicted to cannabis. \"What? No way, it's not addictive like booze or opiates, that's crazy\" I would tell my friends or family members who questioned me smoking so much. What I've neglected to tell myself over the years is how I am **mentally** addicted and how that has further consequences on other parts of my life, physical health included.\n\nI've been smoking weed regularly since I was 14 so close to 21 years, and have now been a habitual daily smoker for over 9 years now (average 1.5g/day).\n\nIn that 9 years of daily smoking, I have probably missed a COMBINED max of 60 days in total smoking. To say weed is a part of my life is an understatement. And I actually believe it has done many wonderful things for me over the years. It is truly an amazing plant with so many benefits, but I am now at a point where the cons are outweighing the pros.\n\n1st - The money. Average of 1.5g (some days it's 1g some days 2) is an expensive habit. Especially when you factor in that it's only the past couple of years prices have come down. When I was in my teens and 20s, where I live an ounce was about $280-$320 for the majority of my time smoking, only in the past three years have I been getting through my medical provider ounces for $175-$220. That's about 19 ounces a year costing me roughly $4k. Like what the fuck? There's so much more I could be doing with that money. My wife and I aren't poor, but we are a typical struggling middle class. That $4k a year has definitely put a strain on my wife and I as any financial problems usually do for married couples.\n\nMy wife is also a smoker, but a very very casual smoker and has never been a daily smoker like me. She has always been supportive of me and understands why I love cannabis as much as I do, but she has also seen the toll it has taken on me over the years so she actively encourages me to \"cut back\" or to \"try and go a day without it\" and before I know it the bowl is loaded and I'm ripping the bong anyways. It hurts her and I see that, though she would never tell me. I'd rather be able to use the money to help us out, which in turn will only help our relationship.\n\n2nd - My health. I just recently lost my Dad a few months ago to cancer. He was only 60. His dad before him was only 57 and died with cancer. They were both alcoholics, my brother is also a borderline alcoholic.\n\nSince Dad passed, I've been doing a lot of self-reflecting and I'm noticing more and more every day how I have a lot of similarities to the people in my life who struggle with other substances. Absolutely, alcohol is worse for you 10x over than cannabis, but my mannerisms, my actions, thought-processes, all extremely similar. I guess it's the addictive personality I have and most of my family has, I just happened to choose a different substance. I don't go out and socialize unless I'm high. I don't do any activities sober. I don't hang out with my friends sober (and 9/10 of my friends are not smokers). I get baked before going to work every day. This all leads to some pretty terrible life choices towards my health. Terrible eating habits, terrible sleeping habits, and this all then leads to anxiety and depression issues at times for me. It's caused me to gain weight, I'm completely out of shape.\n\nAs I said I've been smoking for over 20 years and the majority of that has been my bong. I've tried several vapes, have tried switching to edibles, but I just keep going back to my bong. Sure it may not be as bad for you as tobacco, but let me tell you from first hand experience, all these years of the bong have hurt my lungs. I feel it. I get tired doing any cardio related activity because I just don't breathe like I used to. Waking up in the mornings I feel the excess mucus just waiting to be coughed up. I'm 35, if I don't do something soon to get my body in better condition I will probably end up dead close to the same time as my Dad and his before him.\n\n3rd - My daughter. My world. My everything. She is 3 years old. Over the Christmas holidays, I had a moment; an epitome if you will.\n\nI had lots of time to hang out with my daughter over Christmas which we don't always get due to me working shift work. Some days I'm home 5pm, others not until 9pm and she is in bed. I thought \"Christmas will be fantastic, I'll get some time with her before going back to work\".\n\nAnd we did. We had a helluva Christmas. Then one night towards the end of it all, my wife was gone out with some friends and my daughter asked \"Daddy can we play with my new Play'Doh?\"\n\nI told her that Daddy was tired and we couldn't play with Play'Doh right now. Instead I opted to get her a snack, flick on a movie for her, then go smoke a bowl so I could play guitar while she watched a movie.\n\nI turned down the opportunity to play with my daughter to get high and play guitar. And that fucking kills me. That was the moment when I thought to myself \"Sure, she's only 3 now but if this continues it's going to have bigger consequences than I could imagine, my addiction could hurt our relationship as she grows older\". Yes, I know it's important to have the time for myself and my own interests as well, but couldn't that have waited an hour or so til she was in bed?\n\nAnd that's what brought me here. I need to quit this beautiful plant that was my first love. A love that I need to learn to let go. And I need to quit for good. I am not one of those people who can do something in moderation. The word moderation just does not work for me personally with cannabis. If I could keep it to smoking say on a Friday/Saturday night? Gosh that would be glorious. However I know that, if weed is in the house, I'll be smoking it. So along with the Saturday night high would be a Sunday morning wake n bake. Moderation and me don't mix.\n\nSo now starts my journey. Today is Day 1. I don't know where to start for support, but that's one of the beautiful things about Reddit, I knew I would find a sub that would help me just talk and get shit off my chest and find other people to relate to. Lo and behold I have already read a few threads from people similar to me.\n\nIt's going to be a hard battle for me, but what better prize than my health and my family.\n\nCheers friends.", "2_timestamp": "2018-01-10 16:43:49", "3_author": "Balistix", "comments": [{"Modric-87": [{"dshfx62": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-01-10 14:07:04", "1_text": "Yeah, thats the thing with addiction, the longer you use, the more lines get crossed until you get snapped and then its waiting for the consequences.

I feel like I could do without drugs to some degree, the issue is that I just feel like plain shit .. day in and day out. It never gets better and I've had serious suicidal depression since I was 7 years old and am now 21 (3 weeks I'll be 22) and once I found drugs, it was a game changer in my life. After experimenting with so many different substances I can't count on 4 hands the different ones I've done, my favorite .. are dissociatives. Why? Ever heard about Ketamine being studied for depression. That's why. Well, DXM is very similar to Ketamine except it has much more potent action on serotonin and has a much longer half life and is fucking over the counter. Second favorite being Nitrous Oxide and Air Duster but I can easily do without those. Those are just wonky drugs when I'm looking to get weird. But the DXM or Ketamine? It is so fucking hard to stay away and that drug has given me this feeling I've never had before that feels more than just a drug. It feels like a state of being that is attainable without drugs, but all the shit I got going on in my mind, I don't feel like I can attain it without DXM. It completely rids me of depression, anxiety, Depersonalization, etc for DAYS after doing it. It literally fixed my issues and no other drug on the planet has given me this feeling of being truly alive. Not coke. Not heroin. Not adderall. Not shrooms. Not LSD. Not molly. Those are all fun, but DXM wasn't just a hallucinogen. It was legit medicine. It literally fixed my depression as long as I kept doing it. It didn't have to be everyday. Every other day or every 3 days. Kept the dosages below full blown trips. Just to get that magical, ALIVE feeling. When I got back into it again a few months ago, I was like \"holy shit, I'm back.\" I felt in the moment. Happy. Content. Present. Alive. Welp, been bouncing around rehabs for several months and now I'm finally out but god damn is it hard... I'm back on SSRI's but I just feel like they can't suffice. I've been on max dosages before of other meds and while they kinda helped, it didn't compare to DXM. I feel unable to feel fully connected to myself and benefit from therapy either without DXM. It makes me so in tune with my thoughts and feelings and feel safe to articulate it to others. The way it makes me feel, I'm perfectly fine taking it forever even if it fucking kills me down the road. I've been without it for several months now and I'm almost debating using it again even though it's dangerous to combine it with SSRI's. I just feel like I'm time traveling until the next time I do DXM where I get that \"woah I'm back\" feeling.\n\nAnyone relate?

This info is not intended to make myself sound all-knowing or intended to brag in any way. It is just background that is influencing my views. There is a drug and alcohol rehab here that has a long history and works with the legal system in their own county and surrounding counties. They call parole and probation officers to force clients into any recommended treatment if the client happens to be in legal trouble. There are some clients there who chose to go voluntarily and there is a very low rate of completion for people who seek the service of their own free will. The facility is so used to bullying and forcing their clients into a set treatment plan that they really have no idea how to handle clients they do not possess such leverage over. I feel that reporting to POs as a method of forcing compliance, and of course if someone fails a drug test, is violating HIPAA and unacceptable behavior from health care providers. I had experience with patients on parole or probation at times. Their POs are not interested in the well-being of their charges in most cases. The place I had the most trouble with them was a skilled nursing facility treating people who had been in accidents. I fought to keep POs away fro them because I was there to care for my patients, not play snitch for the legal system. The counselors at this rehab will not acknowledge that their policy is a problem and clients can not actually get the benefits they should because they can't trust their counselors. Phone calls to POs are not just for dirty drug screens or not attending. They also call if the client is doing something they dont approve of or if they feel the client is not in a good situation at home. They fight and bully until clients finally agree to do what the counselor says and this often results in misery, hatred and mistrust of the people they are supposed to be able to rely on for help, and relapse. A relapse is nearly guaranteed when a person in early recovery is trapped in a situation causing them to be upset, angry, depressed, and hopeless. I just do not understand how people trained in the field and working in such a specialty do not comprehend how detrimental their policies of usings the legal system to bully is to their client's success in treatment. They claim it is 'voluntary' and their clients always 'have a choice' and this is true, to a point. Clients must sign a consent form. The other part of that equation is if they do not sign it the counselor immediately informs the person's PO and then the PO threatens to revoke if the consent isn't signed. There is also a great deal of coercion in other aspects of life. \"Recovery first\" is used to justify some really awful actions. Clients are told they have to leave their children in the care of relatives in order to devote all of their time to attending counseling and services. People concerned for pets are told the same. Finances, losing their homes, sick relatives, and so on are all dismissed as being of concern and the mantra of 'recovery first' is repeated. I truly can not stand this place. They aren't helping anyone. The facility is making a lot of money and they also own a share in some housing units associated with the facility. Clients are 'encouraged' to live in those apartments at 400 per room. Each apartment has 4 bedrooms. I don't know what to do. This isn't right but I have no idea how to fix it.

Your idea of starting a real treatment facility certainly has merit. Unfortunately many of the ones that have opened since the broad change in sentencing to include treatment are opening to get themselves a slice of the pie, not to help anyone. I was so optimistic and thankful when local judges started to alter sentencing to treatment and 'drug court' instead of just using jail time. Now I realize that there is nothing that will not be corrupted by greed. Some of the people referred to these programs don't even need that level of care. You are certainly correct in stating addicts can be slippery. A 20 year old caught driving with a BAC of .04 isn't really an addict. He/she could be, but its certainly not guaranteed and it isn't uncommon for people under 21 to drink at times. I brought up that example because I know of one person with a very similar situation who is stuck in a year long addiction treatment curriculum. Everyone who is evaluated is labeled as being an addict/alcoholic. If they don't give that label they won't get all that money for 'treatment.' Considering the battle over Medicaid funding currently being fought in government it might be a sensible idea to look into this. Most of these people are getting treatment through Medicaid and I would classify much of their actions as fraud. Thank you both for the feedback and suggestions.

My girlfriend is not an addict, and has never done any drugs, nor is she friends with anyone who does. She tries to be supportive in my recovery - she says she's especially proud that I came to the realization I needed to get clean on my own. She never tried to steer me toward recovery because, for the length of our relationship, I haven't had addiction control my life the way it used to. However, I was still drinking, still smoking pot, etc. But I am much stronger than I used to be, so I decided it's time to get sober and stay that way. \n\nThe thing is, after telling her how my addiction affected my life and described some of my worst moments from my past, I can sense her fear growing. She wants to understand, but she just doesn't - not really. I mentioned possibly going to NA meetings, but I am nervous since I have never been to one so I am admittedly dragging my feet. I did though, set up a few appointments with my therapist who is licensed to counsel for addiction. \n\nHere's how she seems to be ignorant about addiction: I decided a few months ago to quit smoking cigarettes. Since becoming sober, nicotine gum is just not cutting it all the time and I have had the occasional cig. Not being a smoker or an addict, she's conflicted. She even said, \"You're smoking again. You are **not** sober.\" That's incredibly frustrating because it's a ridiculous statement and I'm proud of my ten days. She doesn't get that nicotine is not a mood-altering substance people use to get high - she just sees that I didn't kick the addiction and worries that will carry over to drugs and alcohol. She's also worried because I still haven't gone to an NA meeting, which is my fault for dragging my feet. But I worry that if I decide NA is not for me then she will fear my sobriety is in jeopardy.\n\nHow can I help her understand? How can I explain the difference between a nicotine addiction and being an *addict*? What can I do to let her know that even though it is hard, I am still making progress that I feel good about? I know she wants to be supportive but I see it causing her stress because she is always worrying about me.", "2_timestamp": "2018-01-13 16:28:56", "3_author": "Klownshuues", "comments": [{"KeepsMakingMistakes": [{"dsmmra4": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-01-13 12:28:18", "1_text": "Congrats on your clean time.

Now that I think back on that, it kind of seems like I had a mini stroke or something - not really sure? I went to the ER though and they did a bunch of tests for my heart/chest, told me I was just having a panic attack. They kept me there for another hour or two though because they said my heart rate was so fast they didn't want me to leave yet.

All fish and reptiles and birds use habits, they save your brain energy from having to think \"How should I brush my teeth today?\"  Instead of thinking about it you just do it by habit.\n\nAddiction is when all your normal brain seeking functions: seeking food, shelter, warmth, human companionship, becomes replaced with only seeking your drug.  So all the parts of your brain that are normally responsible for running your life now only run you towards getting your drugs.  It's why you can't trust your brain when you are an addict, your brain will only motivate you in one direction: get drugs.\n\nBut drug use is a habit at first.  Cigarette smoking especially - in your car, smoke a cig while driving.  Finished eating at a restaurant - go outside to smoke.  And then over time the habit becomes addiction.  It's impossible for most people to say when their drug use habit became an addiction.  Just after a certain amount of time a line is crossed that you can never ever go back from.

Rearrange your browser icons so that you have to click somewhere else to go online, and put your desk and computer in a new location so that you break your old habits of sitting in the same location.

In some cases, this tells our brain to release a hit of dopamine. \n\nHe says that we can change our habits by identifying the trigger, and changing the accompanying behavior and replacing the reward.\n\nI've seen addiction identified as a behavior that is:\n\n* It has made our lives unmanageable\n* we've found ourselves unable to control it\n* it has a destructive and progressive nature  \n\nSo I would say that all addictions could be considered habits, but not all habits are addictions.

In the past, the only thing that has worked for my depression was stimulants which I am obviously trying to avoid, as well as two antidepressants I used without a doctor\u2019s prescription, not approved in the USA where I reside. These medications were also non-abusable. My depression has always been the sole thing that leads to relapse so I want to get it under control desperately. If TMS doesn\u2019t work, the next option is probably ketamine which I want to avoid. Bromantane acts similar to a stimulant but lacks any tolerance, dependence, withdrawal, or abuse potential. I am not certain that it will work, I just want to try everything I can before I go to addictive options.\n\nTL;DR: Is it okay to take non-abusable medication for depression that is not prescribed to you because it is not approved in your country if it may help treat your depression and prevent a future relapse?\n", "2_timestamp": "2018-01-14 05:40:04", "3_author": "lynfectious", "comments": [{}]}], "t3_7qb4zg": [{"0_title": "what do i do", "1_text": "after 2.5 years I don't want to have a cigarette but I constantly feel like i want a cigarette. the only way I can stay stopped smoking cigarettes is by constantly distracting myself and moving and having a mint or food in my mouth. if I don't work all I do is sit around and want a cigarette so it's got to the point I am in so much pain from my back from work I am to scared to stop because my cravings for cigarettes will come back. i think it may be a mouth thing , i don't know where to go from here. worked non stop, spent 2 days crying in pain, back to sore then wam cig cravings so bad i could taste it. so tired from constantly fighting cravings. got sick (cancer but okay now) plus my mother died slowly and painfully  the course of my treatment with me trying to hide i was sick from her,  few months after i gave up but honestly to me giving up the cigarettes was harder than the chemo and radiation am cured, have no money problems , should be happy but ...such stupid 1st world problem. went to a drug counselling it was so bad , found out in the middle had thyroid problem which can be associated with continuing 'withdrawal symptoms' medication for thyroid has helped to an extent but feel the only way i can beat this is work 24/7 and never relax or do anything enjoyable again because i don't enjoy much with out cigarette. stupid i know. alcohol, drugs can take or leave, don't eat meat, never used to touch sugar now have to stop myself shoveling in my mouth. think its hard because of trying not to cross addict plus grumpy as shit all the time because i want cigarette. is so bad that i can not be around people smoking because if i inhale 2nd hand smoke i start craving as badly as when i first stopped. sometimes i feel okay but as soon as i relax it's back.  plus have never been so sick since i stopped (cancer totally not smoke related) had every scan mri etc lungs fine but never felt so bad. but have asthma since i gave up go figure...most of my friends say start smoking again stop torturing yourself but having had cancer once don't want to invite cancer into my body again . where do i go from here please? i feel like my body is betraying me by continuing to want cigarettes and yes i have read allen cars book, stopped by vaping/nicotine lozenges, which i no longer use. now not only still want to smoke, also have mint or food in my mouth addiction , have put on weight and feel like shit . where do i go from here please? i didn't post this on the stop smoking sub is because it is mostly newly stopped smokers or happy they have stopped long time non smokers on there and i figure my problem is an addiction thing rather than a cigarette thing plus the only way i can stop this is have something in my mouth thing. i know cigarette smoking can be considered 'only cigarettes' but addiction is addiction whatever you are addicted to and for me this is my addiction. smoked 1-2 packets per day cigarettes for 35 years before i stopped after waking up from an operation on my mouth , was urged to stop as the cigarettes would hurt the healing on my mouth and expensive teeth implants (nothing to do with cancer) and teeth implants might fall out but starting to think mints i suck to stop myself starting again will do as much damage to teeth as cigs.

I go through stages where I have no access to it (through moving somewhere new and no contacts etc.), and do just fine. I feel myself occasionally wish I had a joint, usually only when doing something that would be improved by it (watching a movie, walking on a beautiful trail) but apart from that I forget about it. \n\n\nBut what stays with me is my compulsion to change my mental state. I drink 6 - 10 cups of coffee a day, because I feel myself 'improving' when I drink it. It gets me in the mood to start some project, fill out my budgets, etc. \n\n\nI would do the exactly thing with marijuana, when I had it. Smoking would help me become more creative, more interested in things. \n\n\nOnce I was high, I would prepare myself a coffee, to further 'improve' my state. Once I have the coffee in hand, I'd want a few more tokes because it was wearing off a bit in the 20 mins it took to make the coffee. Afterwards, I would need to refill my coffee. \n\n\nI engage in these spirals of needing to one-up my current mental state 'for the better'. It's a never-ending chase for my 'best self', in terms of mental clarity, thought handling and processing, and creativity. \n\n\nI have taken speed in the past, and while it was never something I abused, I would say I was dependent on it. I knew that taking too much at once would only make me use it up faster, and I'd only need to take more next time. As such it was only ever used in standard, smaller quantities every day. This was easy to maintain. Even when I had been using it for months at a time, the dosage never increased. I had the product in my possession, within arm's reach, and I barely entertained the thought of taking more than my daily dosage. Since I wasn't going to take any more, I still needed to 'improve' my state further somehow. So of course making coffee will further improve my mental state. Smoking marijuana will increase the effects of the speed. I would sometimes become satisfied with my level, but within minutes I would tell myself that I'm coming down now, that the effects are wearing off. That the 'best' mental state had already happened minutes ago, and I was now experiencing less-than-ideal. \n\n\nWhen I don't use these products, I feel that I'm not smart enough, or my thinking abilities could be improved upon. So I do things like drink cranberry juice, or monster energy. Even though I know it is mostly placebo, I still feel my mental abilities improve, even if just by a fraction. And it pleases me. \n\n\nI have a case of beer that I bought two weeks ago, and I've only drank two since. Alcohol makes me feel less than ideal, the opposite direction I want to go. As such I rarely ever consume it, unless in a social setting. \n\n\nI had been a cigarette smoker for 6+ years, until I just stopped one day because I noticed it wasn't having any effect. I knew about cigarette's connection to dopamine, which is perhaps one of the reasons I started in the first place. But once I noticed that they weren't \"doing\" anything to me, quitting was as easy as not buying a new pack. \n\n\nI'm not sure really what I can do about my situation, because I'm not addicted to any drug *per se*, it has more to do with the fact that I'm not content to stay at my current, base, mental state. \n\n\nIt's like having the choice to either be yourself, or yourself but 25% smarter with an improved thought process? For me that decision is obvious, and it is how I view this situation. \n\n\nDoes anyone have this similar feeling, or know what I can do about it?

Shout out to all the goody goodies who take their scripts as prescribed! And an extra special Deuce up to all the scrubs with sticks up their asses, patrolling this sub for posts to hate on. But most of all, much love to the real deal addicts and alcoholics out there: the hopeless drinkers, the bottom of the barrel junkies, the pill and the pipe heads heads - I SEE YOU! And you are not alone! \n\nAnyway,  I love drugs. Love is not a strong enough word. I\u2019m a devotee. And despite all the pain I\u2019ve brought upon myself and those who care about me in the name of my addictions, the drugs themselves still hold a special place in my heart ( and within that special place, a special place for each of my drugs). \n\nWeed was how I got my kicks as an adolescent with a need to be rebellious and \u201cexperiment.\u201d  It floated my boat quite nicely for a while - weed and the mere idea of other, more powerful, dangerous,  and mind expanding intoxicants, especially psychedelics. \n\nWithin a couple years of turning to the dark side I had tried alcohol, MDMA, LSD, shrooms, various pharmaceuticals including Xanax and Vicodin, and cocaine. \n\nBut I never felt real drug induced bliss until my first time taking adderall. Sure, I loved weed; shit I even believed I needed it. And yeah, some of those other drugs were pretty fun too. but once that 30 mg of adderall hit me for the first time, I was a changed person. I remember just floating down the hallways of my high school, loving every minute, every step, sound, image, ugh...that clear headed confidence and sudden interest in all of the world around me; The way my senses became finely sharpened and my libido was pleasantly heightened...that grand feeling blew me away and made me a believer. I didn\u2019t know what exactly I believed in. I just knew  I had seen the light! \n \nLooking back, I wonder if it\u2019s  the drug itself that I fell for.  Or was it what they did for me? or did I fall in love with the idealized person (I thought) they turned me into? \n\nAt any rate, from that day on, drugs were no longer just  a fun way for me to escape from being a pissed off teenager. They were still that too, but they became so much more. They became my life, my everything. I became the drugs. \n\nI have worshiped adderall and Meth and heroin, alcohol, and suboxone, and coke, ...DRUGS... ever since age 16. By age 20 I had discovered needles and began injecting any drug that was water soluble. Talk about bang for your buck! \n\nAround this time, 2 Years out of high school and 2 years farther down the rabbit hole, I became utterly dependent on opiates: dilaudid, oxycodone, heroin. To make matters worse, I had also graduated from eating adderall to shooting crystal meth. Those two powerhouses - the tar and the crystal - turned out to be my favorite weapons of self destruction. If I pick them up I\u2019m fucked. That, I have proven to myself time and time again. But I can\u2019t seem to keep away. This is my line of thinking 10 rehabs In by the way. \n\nNow I\u2019m 25. I\u2019ll still take a handful of adderall if given the chance. Hell, I still smoke weed if someone passes it, even though it reliably produces paranoia that becomes panic and terror. I\u2019ve been on and off suboxone maintenance for the past 6 years - mostly on, as I only managed to scrape together fa few months here and there while in treatment. I\u2019m  finally off all opiates and no longer deal with constant threat of withdrawal. I sometimes crave a shot of heroin but overall I feel I\u2019m in a much better place as far as painkillers and H.\n\nIt\u2019s been 5 weeks since my last shot of crystal. Also, I have not touched a needle in as long. This is very good too since I\u2019m a nonfunctional shell of a man when I do meth. Same pattern always: I binge heavily for anywhere from a couple weeks to 6 months,  emerging a tattered pitiful mess, barely alive and unable to keep using, unable to keep living and breathing even - without professional assistance. This most recent run had me homeless and penniless, motel hopping and walking the streets with ridiculous amounts of dope in my blood.  By the time I ran out of money and options I had gotten my car stolen, which contained everything I owned including the entirety of my wardrobe. \n\nNow I\u2019m into gabapentin. id never have guessed how much Id get off and the subtle pleasant buzz it gives me. But I\u2019m hooked and it is addictive and I do get withdrawals...anyway, I\u2019m sure gabapentin is on it\u2019s way to becoming a controlled substance, scheduled by the federal government. It\u2019s recreational value or street value is roughly equivalent to that of Ativan or ritilan in my opinion. \n\nAs if I didn\u2019t have enough poison on my plate, I\u2019ve developed quite a taste for alcohol over the past few years. And I don\u2019t  mean in  a mature \u201cbecoming a man, enjoying the taste of good beer\u201d kind of a way. No, when I develop a taste, I develop a ravenous hunger ..or thirst. I guess I knew I might have a problem with alcohol when I found myself chugging listerine in my car behind Dairy Queen with nowhere to go. The old time county music station was on and I\u2019ll never forget the deep sadness and heartache  in those notes and words. I was Drunk and lonely, with a thousand pound heart and a bottle. And It felt safe. \n\nAs far as actual human relationships go I have little experience as an adult. As much as I indulge and in and become intimate with chemicals, I have a crippling fear of doing the same with people. I haven\u2019t had a girlfriend since I was 22. I haven\u2019t had sex for over two years. I used to hang out a lot with a friend who got high with me. His mother supplied the stuff so It wasnt a good situation. I consider him an actual friend too but he moved on and we haven\u2019t hung out in years. Other than that, its been since high school that I had a group of friends. But as much as I want sex, The fear of life and people keeps me clinging to addiction in spite of my human nature. And sometimes I do want companionship, but I feel that there isn\u2019t room for people and their problems and their lives  within my fucked up world. I always think of it like this: I\u2019m married  to the needle. I\u2019m a faithful partner. \n\nWhipped. \n\nI wish there were an interesting and fluid way for me to tie all this up and make it seem thought out and insightful. But I\u2019m literally riffing this off the top and I know it\u2019s mostly run-on garbage. But thanks for reading it through. You must not have a lot going on ;p \n\nThis is for the junkies like me, alone but not alone. I\u2019ve been dead to the world for quite some time. well hello world.

I reached the point of no return where i had to come clean to my girlfriend and family that i had a severe cocaine addiction. I had emptied my partners and my bank account. Risked our house by not paying rent and other bills. Left us with not a penny to our name plus a \u00a34K coke bill on top of that. \n\nI left my house around 16:30 after carefully penning a message to my girlfriend explaining the situation as best i could, asked her to stay at her mums whilst i had no idea where i was going or what the end would look like for me. I was / still am suicidal. \n\nTo my surprise, my girlfriend has opted to stick by me and actually phoned my dealer and pledged 2K at the end of this month to cut my bill in half.\n\nShe has completely gutted our house to remove any trace of the drug, gave back what she found to the dealer. I'm genuinely shocked she has stayed by me. I wouldn't have. I don't deserve it.\n\nTo give anyone reading this a bit of insight, i have always used drugs recreationally since the age of around 13. Cannabis - Speed - Ecstasy - Cocaine - Ketamine - Acid, gives you a progessional timeline of my drugs experiences but cocaine was always my go to drug since I was in full time employment. It seemed so glamorous and as time has went by, basically everyone does it. Its ritualistic, have a few pints with the boys, take a few lines. Rinse. Repeat.\n\nWith the increase in popularity i seen an opportunity to supply the masses and get my own for free. Which worked fantastically up until around 8-12months ago when the drug really gripped me hard. This led to me becoming reclusive amongst my friends and mainly railing cocaine hard when i was on my own.\n\nTo make matters worse, whilst my girlfriend knew i did it to an extent, she hated it so i had to hide it all the time. It led to lies rolling off my tongue more often than not. \n\nFrom Thursday 4th to Friday 12th Jan, I went through 2oz by myself, in secret. I took 3 days off work during this time. This is disgusting behavior and quite frankly I\u2019m confused as to why I\u2019m still here.\n\nAnyway, here I am, 72 hours clean. Cold, itchy, tired and really really hungry.

I dont wanna spoil the party, but I think you are addicted already. Addiction isnt bound to one substance or act and when you shut that off you aint addicted anymore. Addiction is about escaping life, setting it on hold, putting yourself in any kind of state so you wont have to deal with the everyday problems we face while being sober. I started at a very young age with my addicting behaviour in the form of videogames and movies, I could do it all day long so I escaped life. After that fitness followed, sex, porn, alcohol, pills, cannabis, cocaine...anything thats usefull to not have to think about my life and its difficulties. \n\nI really suggest you go to a meeting from AA, CA or NA. The people there are just like us and are talking about how to deal with life being sober, because as an addict we didnt learn that in a healthy way. We use, to deal with life and thats never a happy ending story. \n\nAlso try to read as much as possible about addiction and watch documentairies on youtube? Im reading Recovery now from Russel Brand and its awesome, he explains it so easy and with a lot of humor. I also love to watch psychiatrich Gabor Mate, the guy is a legend.\n\nBeating addiction is in my opinion bestly done by informing yourself as best as possible, find out why you react on situations that 99% of the time lead to using and have a good support group of people in recovery. \n\n2 years ago I was very far into active addiction and I just did it without thinking. The more I searched for the reason why I used and how addiction works in the brain, the better I can act on it in a healthy way.

One of my main drugs of choice was DXM, I know how powerful that drug can be. It might have a silly reputation, but it's in the same class as Ketamine and PCP.  As you probably know, but I'm painting the picture for other readers.\n\nWhen it comes to being addicted or not, a good way to look at it is most people who are not addicted never have to even ask the question in a serious manner. Addiction isn't always what you see on TV and in the media. Its very cunning and comes in many disguises that many people fail to see as their lives crumble around them.\n\nWhats important here is that if you feel like you have a problem, you do and you need help. Regardless of what the substance is. I would recommend going to a few NA meetings and listening to peoples experience and sharing your own.  you will find a lot of identification there and will have a chance to stop your problem from progressing. Plus it free. The only thing that people care about this is if you have a desire to stop using. Ive been to many meetings high, and have never been rejected. \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that DXM is a very heavy drug that has some pretty long last psychological effects. Time will clear this up, therapy and NA can help speed things up for you. \n\nFeel free to PM if you have any questions, I highly encourage you to seek out some help. The end of the road for you does not end well if you keep going. There is a reason why you don't see people using these drugs for life, or most drugs for that matter. \n\nPlease know that is not hopless and you can get to a state where you do not have to use drugs to be happy and live a good life. Recovery because of a lot easier than using after a certain point and its something everyone can achieve.

I\u2019m 23 and have a 2.5 yr old daughter and an on and off ex.\n\nI have a Percocet addiction. I LOVE percs.  What drew me, and continues to draw me to the drug is the feeling. Every mg of that crushed up little blue (green, grey or yellow) pill is one of the best feelings I\u2019ve ever felt. What sucks is that everything feels so perfect when I\u2019m on a perc, in reality I destroy the people around me, but I feel good so I don\u2019t care. Percs affect people in different ways, some people it fades them out and makes them feel good while being in and out of it, for me it was a little different.  Percs were like cocaine or adderall for me. They would give me laser focus and make my brain work in\nOverdrive. I process things a lot quicker and they give me an unmatched energy.  I used to excel at school while consistently using them, which helped make them such a draw.  \n\nlast November I got a text from my ex\nSaying that she wasn\u2019t happy with our relationship bc of what percs do to me. Now I thought things were perfect bc I was feeling\nGood, but didn\u2019t realize how much I was hurting the people around me. She wanted out, and wanted me in rehab. We sat down with her and my parents and discussed options, I was\nAble to stay out of rehab bc I have a great sales\nJob and didn\u2019t want to lose it. We set up a plan, I would have no access to cash, share location of my phone, submit to drug tests, go to NA meetings etc, etc. Long story short I play the game for 2-3 months until I stop getting drug tested and get my money back I went right back to doing percs. Have been caught 2 more times by parents or the ex and will shape up until they relax their rules then I go right back to percs. \n\nOne of the things that makes recovery so difficult for me is my ex. We had a great relationship before and then the pregnancy really rocked us and I handled it terribly. I began to drink heavily and abuse drugs, and even woke up in at the hospital bc I overdosed even after that I only shaped up until the rules were relaxed. I also found out that when she wanted out she had just started another relationship, and kept that going secretly for about 6 months. I completely understood why bc of all I had done, but it still hurt like hell knowing she betrayed me and would be the main reason I relapse when I feel it\u2019s hopeless. She used to be the one and only person I could trust and count on, and when I needed her most she was out. Now I can\u2019t get back together with her even tho it\u2019s all she wants, but I can\u2019t and don\u2019t think I ever will be able to trust her. \n\nI just wanted to share my story because I know how fucking hard recovery is. You have to be strong and have the right supper group around you to succeed. But ultimately it\u2019s up to you, if you don\u2019t have the willpower to stop or call someone and ask for help then recovery is going to be nearly impossible.

I do however, feel pretty weak right now. \n\nA few days ago, I thought about going to NA, but I decided to come here to Reddit first. The replies I got were basically \"Yes, get to a meeting\" - and I knew that I needed to, because the feeling of relief I got just from getting the support from other addicts here on Reddit was encouraging in a way I just don't get from the non-addicts in my life. I knew at the very least, I need to meet some people who know what I'm going through.\n\nSo, I figured out two meetings I wanted to attend in one day. I chose two in case I got lost or got held up and something made me late, so I'd have a backup. I really wanted to make at least one. I'd been dragging my feet and making excuses and I decided today is the day.\n\nI arrived to the first location, at a small clinic. No one was there. I thought, \"That's weird. I don't know what's going on, but at least there's another meeting even closer to where I live at 7:30\"\n\nFast forward to 7:15, I'm at the location which is this enormous megachurch near my apartment. I'm waiting in the room, wondering why no one is there yet. 7:30 comes and I start feeling confused and anxious, and check the meeting time, day, and location on the NA website on my phone again. I'm in the right place. By 7:40 I feel like an idiot because I'm still by myself, and I leave the church. I thought, \"Two meetings in one day that didn't exist... What shit luck do I have?\" I got home and sat in my car for nearly an hour crying. I messaged another redditor who offered to talk to me, because that's all I had. \n\nI had a lot of nervousness about going to a meeting for the first time. But I didn't even consider I could go to two meetings that didn't exist. I wasn't expecting that, and I was not emotionally prepared for how lonely that would feel.\n\nI have used the NA website, the NA meeting finder app, and my local NA area site. The meeting list is not completely consistent between the three, and the local area site (which I imagine would be most accurate) appears to be out of date, too. There are two meetings listed near me today, and they are both at the exact locations I went before, just a different day now obviously. I can't handle sitting in another empty room and feeling like I'm all alone. It actually feels like an affirmation that I am alone. I know that I can't do this on my own and I need to get to a meeting, but my experience so far has made me feel like Reddit is all I have.\n\nI know that realistically, if I went to every single listed meeting, I'd find one.

It's the practice of becoming aware of your thoughts, acknowledging them and gently releasing those thoughts. When you practice regular meditation, you will find that mindfulness will leak out of your meditation and improve your day through giving you the ability to recognize lingering or festering thoughts.\n\nNotice - mindfulness meditation is NOT about \"clearing your mind.\" When we try to focus on \"clearing our mind,\" it often has the opposite effect. Rather, the goal is to just concentrate on your breath.\n\nJust sit in a comfortable position and focus on the breath.\nWhen a thought comes (because it will), allow it to come. Recognize it and acknowledge that it's there.\nGently give yourself permission to dismiss the thought, as if to say \"I see, you - you're there. Now I will go back to my breath.\"\nSet a timer (I use the Insight Timer app) and start with a short amount of time like 5 minutes. Slowly increase that time.\nWhen you meditate regularly, you will find answers in the stillness. A quiet mind is much easier to \"reign in\" and when you're triggered by a thought of a past sexual encounter, memory of getting drunk, smell or taste that brings you back, trigger location, provocative vision, etc., you'll be able to treat it with mindfulness. You'll be able to say \"I see you. It's natural to notice you. And now I gently give myself permission to dismiss the thought.\" Being gentle with yourself is key. Don't beat yourself up.\n\nI hope this was helpful.

I've been depressed and anxious most my life, also diagnosed with ADHD and bipolar disorder. Mental illness runs in my family. Recently i got laid off from my job and that's when i started using meth to kill the boredom. \n\nI feel trapped. I started using phenibut to control my behavior at work. I disliked my call center job so much i would lose my temper, pound my desk, make a scene etc. Phenibut eliminated that side of me and probably saved me from getting fired. However a negative side effect started showing up in that I could only sleep about 5 hours on average a night. Raising the dosage didn't help so I started illicitly obtaining klonopin and the side effect went away. The combination of 3 grams of phenibut a day and 2 mg of klonopin every other day worked well for about 6 months until I got laid off. Now I'm in a situation where I'm unemployed and addicted. Even if i were to flush all the drugs and get completely clean, my only work experience the last 20 years is in call centers. I can't deal with the stress of a call center job without something to take the edge off. \n\nRegarding the meth, I know I could stop using it if I could just get back in some kind of routine. I need to find work but having all these addicitions weighing on my mind is creating so much self-doubt. BTW, I saw a Dr and asked him about phenibut addiction and he had no idea what it was.

I'm not going to try and give you any beneficiali advice, or recommend advice.\n\npheno can do the same things an anyxolyltic does. They're often called (natures Xanax) taken responsibly they can help in the U.S where they're still considered uncontrolled by the FDA, and one the last I used it.\n\nI haven't used phenobut in a very long time, though the easiest real substance to aquire It requires you to use hours before its effect takes part. Anything shorter and its not pheno. Phenobut acts as a very slow releasing medication that gradually overtakes the same reactors in your brain that alcohol, and benzodyanzapines will. This means abusing it can lead to delirium during cold turkey withdrawals, and, possible seizures.\n\nAlchohol, and benzodiazepines ( Xanax,  lorazepam, helium,  and ativan) present the same problem. It feels good but becoming dependt upon it causes a number of propblems.\n\n\nAlcohol, and benso withdrawal.... Both can not only cause the DT's, (Delerium Tremens) but you also risk death during withdrawal due to extreme seizures. Generally in either withdrawal, both are potentially fatal. \n\nDon't get addicted to Phenobut. It interacts with the same chemical receptors in the brain but by releasing an enormous.amount phenyl A, and B receptor signals.\n\nThe Phenyl ring is the only reason Phenobut works. It floods the brain with gabba A, and B signals where ordinary gabba is not capable passing the blood barrier so easily. It literally floods the brain A,B, and C chemical signals. Phenobut is essentially an long reaction, long lasting, clean Xanax. \n\nProblem is it doesn't solve anything....\n\nIll continue in another reply shorty..."}], "dst6we2": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-01-17 05:01:06", "1_text": "PART: 2\n\nAs per my first response. You're in a situation that calls for some form of health treatment. I know it doesn't sound pleasant, its not supposed to be. You have a few options.\n\nMany in fact:\nNA, AA, etc ( there are more than several groups) to do what's called \"group therapy\" you'd be surprised how many people have either gone through the same, or have experienced worse. Talking can be therapeutic, especially to a group.\n\nDon't be afraid to go to meetings. AA, MA, NA and all others are welcome no matter what. \n\nIf lets say that's not your thing, okay bro. Maybe seek out therapy, drug counciling. There's a chance your job insurance includes, and even encourages recovery behavoir. You getting better is all that is needed. You can do it, I know you'll find a way.\n\nMeth... CNS stimulants can be very hard to combat. They tap straight into your dopamine response system and produce a chemical reward surpassing that of cocaine. These come in numerous forms levoamphetamine, dextroamphetamine etc. However methamphetamines are quite potent. More so than regular CNS Stimulants including amphetamines. Instead of releasing a low amount of dopamine they release an enormous amount.\n \nIn my own recovery, I've used them. Meth, and prescription. I recommend using therapy (not pshyciatric) to deal with them.\n\nWARNING: Using a benzo, and drinking alcohol will potentiate the effects: As in using clonazepam, zoralpam, helium, alprozalam will make a single beer feel like 3 to 5 beers. It will make otc sleeping aids more potent. DONT USE BOTH OF EITHER!\n\nRisks for anyxolyltic substances include death by seizure ( due to withdrawal ), severe suppression of the respiratory system (due to use).\n"}]}], "loopernow": [{"dstj4ee": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-01-17 09:59:50", "1_text": "I worked call center jobs for four years.

The 2nd one was slightly better because at least the company was related to education, which I was interested in. That job actually led to me getting an office job for a for-profit college (that also blew, but not nearly as much as a call center) and now I have a job at a private college.\n\nMy point is, you're absolutely right, call centers blow. Get any other sort of job and think about how you can get into a job, eventually, that you like a lot more.

It seemed sustainable, it didn't seem to be interfering with my life, and it gave me a pick up during a long day at work.  There was also not a financial burden since it was almost free for me.  Perfect storm, right?\n\nI did not use socially, it was just for me.  I wasn't hiding it as there were a few friends who also casually used, but I was not open about it with my GF.  It took about 9 months for her to find one, and then it was out.  \n\nIt was difficult because I didn't feel like I was an addict, but I knew that I couldn't just stop because of the physical dependency.  For myself I went to a doctor for medical assistance (suboxone), and for my GF I went to addiction talk therapy.\n\nThe talk therapy was helpful and it forced me to introspect on the things that being on a drug all the time DID take away, mainly spending quality time with my GF.  It did not stop, but it definitely was not a priority because I felt great all the time.  It's funny how many little things this affects when you take a good hard look at it.\n\nI tried to stop without Suboxone, and it was truly hell.  I went on Suboxone and everything was better.  I didn't feel sick, and I didn't feel high.  It was a relief...but from what I read, people said that it was trading one dependency for another.  I didn't like the prospect of that, but I persevered and did not touch oxy during treatment.  It took about 3 months to wean off, and in the first 2 - 3 days there was mild anxiety.  After this I just said screw it, and have not thought about it again.\n\nSuboxone is amazing.  TAKE IT AS PRESCRIBED.  DON'T SLIP UP.  It can be so easy to say, \"What's one going to do, it's been 6 months...\".  This medication removes the physical dependency fairly quickly without disrupting your life.  Ending it was about as serious as a hangover, and then you're free, physically.  If you're hooked on oxy or any opiate, TRY THIS without using.  It's a miracle...at least it was for me on 90mg a day.\n\nNow, I'm having a hard time in therapy, however, as they are pressuring me to do 12 steps, go to group meetings, and put on a mantle of \"addict\" for the rest of my life.  I don't drink other than weddings and social events, I don't use anything else and never did, and only started using because of availability.\n\nI don't have cravings, I'm not 'high' on my ability to get over this, and I don't think I'm being delusional.  I get sick thinking about where this could have led, and I'm rebuilding trust with my GF.  \n\nI don't want to feel like I'm broken for the rest of my life, and I feel like reading through the addiction literature and 12 steps, they're conditioning me to accept that I have an unbeatable weakness.\n\nIs this last bit denial of addiction, or is 12 steps not for everyone?  \n\n", "2_timestamp": "2018-01-18 13:11:53", "3_author": "pillhead123", "comments": [{"PennyFocus": [{"dsvdx7s": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-01-18 09:50:29", "1_text": "12 steps are DEFINATELY NOT for everyone.

I started working at this job, was earning good money, then i give this guy a message to buy some weed purely because he used to have the same car as me, then we clicked and this is where it all went wrong.\n\nHe was a drug dealer, I would spend everyday with him, smoking weed, driving around with him selling weed etc, I literally got to the point I was with him more than my family and my GF, purely for the fact I was smoking so much weed and it was free most of the time too, going into a downward spiral. \n\nIt got to the stage, my gf started cheating on me not long after she had lost our baby, but I didn't know at this point but we were falling out a lot on and off like a toaster etc, then one night I seen a text on her phone which read out \"can I see you again\", I was like wtf, anyway that shit was over.\n\nMy mental health was going on a forever downward spiral, I was spending every penny I got on weed, if I didn't have any I would sell anything I could, I feel absolutely disgusted with myself because my mum bought me a new PS4 for Christmas one year, I sold it for weed, bought me another ps4 And I sold that one again for weed, I think I have had about 4 PlayStation 4s, after all this, my mum got me an Xbox one and I promised I would not sell it, but I got into a big argument and decided to leave home brought it with me and sold it, and bought you guessed it, weed, I feel like such a right cunt, then I started getting into arguments with my parents because I never had a job and all I did was lie around and get stoned every single day.\n\nI became a recluse, I stopped socialising with everyone, my family, everyone, I was close to so many people who would have done anything for me, now I had absolutely no one.\n\nThe arguments got so so bad, it got to the point where walls where being punched, things where being broken, me and my father where almost killing eachother etc \n\nThen I got thrown out of the house, I was staying with the drug dealer dude most of the time, making no money, just smoking weed. \n\nThen I stopped it and moved back in, kept on doing the same shit and got thrown back it again, I think I have been thrown out about 7 times in the space of two years. \n\nSo Last year I was still smoking weed, then unfourtunatley I had a serious back injury to which I was prescribed tramadol, at first I never ever took them, I always swapped my script for a bag of weed, then one day my back was pretty sore and I decided to take one, then this is where it all started.\n\nIt started off with me taking tramadol, and don't get me wrong I won't lie it felt like it was an absolute god send to me, it took away all my pain, my depression, anxiety, and made me feel so calm and so happy to the point where nothing could get me down, I felt so motivated and outgoing, but boy was I in for a hellish ride, I became homeless again due to another family issue, I was homeless and had 0 contact with my family for around six months, I started getting worse mentally because not one of my other family would help or let me stay in their house etc I felt so worthless, I was going from friend to friend, then when I outstayed my welcome I started sleeping in the hospital A&E, all while my tramadol addiction was getting worse. \n\nOne of my friends let me stay in his uncles, great I thought, everyday taking a few trams and getting that on top of the world warm comfortable feeling, then one day I ran out and it was hell, I had never experienced anything like it in my life, I felt really scared, the sheer feeling of fear and panic, along with anxiety, I couldn't sleep, I could not sit still, every bone in my body hurt, breathing hurt, I was so so weak, sweating, skin burning, getting electric like shocks throughout my body, i stopped smoking weed because it got to the point where I preferred the tramadol, but I had decided that enough was enough, after just randomly crying and having withdrawels I decided to call my mum and ask for help which at first she was reluctant to do but a few days later I went home.\n\nI had promised to stop taking trams and weed and get help, and get a job and go make something of myself, I broke that promise and believe me I absolutely hate myself in all aspects, To this day I am still using tramadol, no matter how many I take at once, I no longer get any feeling from them, it's as if they don't work anymore, I am taking it so I don't get sick, I know if I stop I will end up killing myself, I feel so worthless, my parents think I've been off them from I came home, but I'm hiding my addiction, I can't tell anyone about it because I will get thrown out of the house again and that will be the final straw. Its so sad that this is what I've become, I've been trying to save to buy the new Xbox or ps pro from like November, my mum said she would go half with me if I can save half, but every fucking time I get money it goes on buying more tramadol, I've had half the money about four times now and my addiction always wins, I feel so worthless, I'm 23, I have No money, I have barely any nice clothes, maybe a nice outfit or two and a pair of airmax and nmds, I literally have one friend, i haven't had a girlfriend in three years not even talked or met another girl, I've lost my hair, I've lost so much weight, my appetite and I used to love food! I am literally just an empty shell wasting away. Everyone thinks I'm fine, but when I'm alone in my room and like now I actually think about everything I just cry like right now, I fucking hate life all together. \n\nAnd to make it worse, when I sleep I have these Absolutley amazing dreams, so realistic and last long, always involving people I'm close to, always having a good time, old friends, then obviously the wierdest dreams but i enjoy them so much I sometimes sleep until 4 and 5 pm in the day and I can always remember them from start to finish and I still can remember them to this day, and when I wake up I feel like crying, I get angry and upset asking myself why the fuck have I woke up, why I couldn't have just slept for ever or just disapeared from exsistance, it's killing me.\n\nNow my parents have gave me two weeks to get a job or I'm out. The immense pressure I'm under is crazy, I am a smart guy but I am so depressed and never have no motivation to do anything or better myself anymore, i feel so empty in my mind, everything is so much effort, even when I see all these people my age from my city all going out with friends, having a good time, posting pictures of their new phones, clothes and driving nice cars, all what I used to have, it puts me down even more, I literally don't know what to do anymore, I have 3Gs of trams left and I honestly feel like swallowing them all hoping I get that feeling and maybe take a siezure and ending it, I hate life, I have absolutely nothing now\n\nI decided trying to ween of them, on Wednesday I had 350MG, today I had 400MG, this is down from over 600MG daily, but I just can't cope with my mental state, I have tried therapy but I just can't seem to connect with anyone and can never let it all out, I always have a feeling of what's the point, any little thing puts me down and I can't go to any addiction programmes because I can't let anyone know and + I don't want to have to go on suboxone or something just substituting one drug for another... \n\nHalf of this probably doesn't even make sense to you guys but I'm honestly just stuck now, that feeling of wanting to just disappear, I just wish I could go back and change things, or as I say just disappear. You know what else got to me?? I seen a picture pop up on Instagram of my ex holding up a baby scan, pregnant to the dude she was cheating on me with, now I honestly am and was totally over it years ago literally after it happened, but for some reason I felt like shit, I felt so down and depressed thinking of all that we went through loosing one and thought how that could have been us \n\nI am just so so drained of life right now", "2_timestamp": "2018-01-19 02:15:37", "3_author": "None", "comments": [{"Dublin4Guy": [{"dswb6ck": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-01-18 19:00:12", "1_text": "I really hope you feel better man.

You set up a TV out there so you could watch something until you turned in for the night. It was drinking during my childhood, and you disguised it as something that hard working men did after a long day at work. But it was every day, and it got to the point that mom felt so isolated that fights began to irrupt. That was middle school, and it was my first glimpse into just how torn this family would become because of your decisions. \n\nYou hurt your back at work shortly after and lost your job due to your injury. A surgery followed and they prescribed you your first dose of the death of our family. It wasn't a big deal the first few years, as you were focused on getting back to work following surgery after surgery. We almost lost the house from the medical bills, but somehow it all turned out okay. You were awarded a settlement. It would help pay for our schooling and to take care of you and mom in your elderly years. Mom stood by you. Family vacations we would take once a year stopped. Then your anger would show when you woke up before taking the pills. The monster was calmed by them, and I figured that was for the best. It wasn't.\n\nA few years ago, the family began to notice you were acting stranger and more distant. You would blank out watching TV when the grandchildren came over. You would forget what you were talking about, and soon would seem to be confused once or twice a week. You separated your banking from mom, and when she had finally seen the dwindled savings account you hid- we knew there was a problem. Your addiction destroyed everything you and mom had worked for. I still forgave you, because after a family talk, we knew rehab would be your best bet. \n\nSo you went for a few months. Work let you do so because of your insurance, and life, for the first time in a long time, began to look up. That monster your pills calmed came out in rehab, and I feel sorry for those who had to share that time with you because I know how it can be so cruel. \n\nBut you came home, looking healthy, fuller, and seeming happier. We went out to dinner to celebrate sobriety. I had hope. Later, you would quietly comment \"well, they said relapse happens most of the time...\" That quote would still haunt me to this day. Weeks after getting out of rehab, I awoke to a frantic call from my mother to go downstairs and check to see if you were alright. You were incoherent, drooling, and shaking. It was the most frightening thing I had ever seen. You had aspirated. You went to some doctor to get more pills. And they gave it to you. And you took it. And it almost killed you. \n\nThat was the beginning of the glimpses we'd see over the next year and a half. You'd seem fine for a while with Suboxone, but then you'd abuse that as well. You had spent your life savings on the pills, and now you were shifting to a new addiction. I thought that would be the end of it, but it unfortunately wasn't. \n\nI got a call last fall from mom again. She had asked if you were visiting my school to drop off a paper. That confused me and she ended the conversation abruptly. I got another call from my brother. He had said you were talking nonsense about losing teeth on your hour drive home from work. You had lost teeth- your body and mind deteriorating together. It wasn't prescribed this time. It was over the counter. You denied and denied and denied, and I finally made you fess up that it was sleeping pills. \n\nYou were taking sleeping pills the moment you woke up. Why? This all began with an injury, and now it had turned into finding your next high. I told you I don't wish to speak with you until you got your act together. The holidays were approaching, and you thought you could cover it up by staying low for a while. I still was angry, but did not let it ruin my holidays.\n\nToday, I got a call from my brother again. Saying that you were jittery and that you were going on about getting your job back. You had lost your job. Again. Because you were fucked up at work. Something we had warned you about over and over. Something therapy was supposed to help. But you don't want to change, so how could any of that work? Instead of sleeping pills, it was Benadryl. Allergy medication. \n\nSo, instead of crying about how you've destroyed this family, I finally told you how I felt tonight seriously. No tears, just calm words. I told you that I hate every bit of who you are anymore. That I don't want a relationship with you like the others. I don't need you to walk me down the aisle because you're not my dad anymore. That everything you've put my mom through is unforgivable. That you were weak. You are. You are dead to me. And the sad part is, I look forward to a time where I don't have to worry about what you will do next. I never thought I could feel so done with my own blood.\n\n\nI hate the prescription industry. I hate that doctors don't think twice about prescribing something that not only kills physically, but emotionally. I hate that people think they're above heroin or coke users because they were prescribed it. They aren't. They're still addicts, and the prescription means nothing to justify it. I hate everything you have put my saint of a mother through. I hate that my nieces and nephews have to grow up distant from their grandpa because we can't trust you. I hate that I don't want you to go down the aisle with me because I'm embarrassed to be related to you. \n\nAnd most of all- I hate you. The glimpse of a dad I once knew who could function is dead in my eyes. Its just a shell of a man who is riddled with addiction. Say it is a disease to those addicted, but it effects those around them just as much. Our family has had to endure this time and time again, and I'm done. As soon as I can, I will go far away and you will be dead to me. I know mom will be in good hands with my siblings, but I cannot sit here and act like I have any love for you again. It is dead and gone. There is no hope. You don't want to change. Its that simple. I see through every lie you've ever fed me. You aren't a man. You're a monster. You've destroyed our family. And I will always hate you for that.

A very good, very expensive preschool.  I'm recently divorced and found myself flirting with one of her teachers.  Most likely about 1/2 my age - but in every single way, she is 'my type.'  \n\nIt never went anywhere - but the flirting was fun.  \n\nFast forward to the end of last year.  She gets fired from her job as a pre-school teacher for some BS violation of policy (she didn't report when a boy went into the girls bathroom.)  Anyway, I've used her as a babysitter a few times since then.  \n\nI am totally and completely attracted to this woman.  So, I call her up because I was taking my daughter to an aquarium and just wanted to see if she would want to go with us.  She did, and we all 3 had a great time.  Kinda ended the night with a \"If you ever want to hang out, call me thing.\"\n\nSo, again, being a divorced dad and coping with all the stress of that, I decided to call her last week to see if she would want to go out.  She said yes and we made plans for this thursday and friday night as I don't have my daughter those two days.  \n\nThursday, she calls me up - says she is sick as a dog and can't make it.  I offer to be her \"doc\" and she said she just wants to be alone and rest - can't keep anything down and basically is suffering from a terrible flu.  \n\nThursday night, she calls me and said, \"Can I come over and sleep on your sofa and watch movies.\"  - Of course, I said yes.  I went and picked her up.  We hung out, watched some movies and fell asleep on the couch.  \n\nThis morning, I get up and go to work.  She is still passed out on the couch.  \n\nI have security cameras inside and outside the house.  My system pings me that there is a car in my driveway.  I open up the cameras and see her walk out of the living room, and get into the back seat of some car for 3 or 4 minutes.  \n\nWhen she gets out, she goes back into my house, gets on the sofa and breaks out a drug kit - unrolls some aluminum foil, pops a glass tube in her mouth and starts burning whatever is on the foil and smoking it... like a lot.  \n\nThen she passes out on the sofa and goes back to sleep. \n\nShe brought drugs into my house.   Smoked them on my sofa.  Violated my trust.  Introduced my house (the outside at least) to a drug dealer - and I had ABSOLUTELY ZERO IDEA WHAT-SO-EVER she was using.  None.  Completely escaped me...\n\nLots of details left out - but my question is this:\n\n1) Do I try to 'help her'\n2) Can I even help her?\n3) Should I help he when i have a kid?\n4) Do I go home, tell her what I saw, call her an uber and tell her to have a nice life?\n5) Do I take her to dinner, and reveal I know what she did/does - and see what happens?\n\n-- I've never dealt with an addict before and I'm at a loss.

Any further contact with someone you know to be an addict, used drugs in your home, exposed you and your child to criminals can and most likely will bite you in the ass if anything were to go sideways with your current custody agreement.

In my opinion you have enough to be getting on with, your child will need all of your emotional support to navigate the divorce. Don't let other people's problems become your problems unless that other person brings something to the table that has more positive benefits to outweigh their problems. My mother was an addict and the constant lying to my dad and us kids, missing money, arguments about bills not getting paid because she said she paid them but spent the money on drugs so one day your dad flips out because he gets a notice in the mail that the mortgage is 3 months behind, the constant worry every time she left the house and didn't come back until late at night. That shit fucked me up for a long time. I have trust issues tot his day. I remember be so anxious as a kid that I couldn't focus at school. Trying to take a test but can't stop worrying that my mom will be dead when I get home from school or arrested. Waiting two hours after school with the janitor because Mom forgot to pick us up. Wondering what happened to my PlayStation and other household goods that got \"stolen\" every so often only to realize much later in life that it was sold for dope money. I'm telling you having an addict in a child's life is hard as fuck on them even if they seem to handle it well. Just don't do it. It's not worth it. While I appreciate what my dad tried to do to keep the family together, I mean the man has a heart if gold to have put up with her shit so long but it really would have been better for us kids if he would have left her early and got full custody.

I try to put this as short as possible, but there's a lot of things I need to mention. I was sexually abused as a child by a relative, and my mother had depression and she became an alcoholic when I was bout 7. There was just the two of us, I have no siblings and my father was in the picture, but he was quite distant to me. He also did some sexually inappropriate things to me since I was 4 or something. On top of all of that, I had childhood rheumatism since I was 2 but it went away by the time I was 9. So, my childhood was never really \"normal childhood\". When I went to school, I was bullied by different people at different times and even sexually harassed by older boys at school when I was 14. I got depressed and didn't go to school, so I went to live with a foster family for a little while. I was 15 then, and started to smoke (topaccos) and drink. I was raped when I was 15 by this older guy and sexually taken advantage by other older guys.\n\n\nAt one point, I found a boyfriend with whom (and my mother) we moved to another, much bigger city. I started high school there and got all A's. I loved studying. When I turned 18 me and my boyfriend split up and just some months after that I found another guy, who was 35 years old and we started dating and soon I moved to his apartment. I finished high school and after that I got severely depressed again and started to go to a psychiatrist. Years went on, I wasn't in school. I tried to kill myself with my antidepressants several times. My partner was always there for me and my mother, who didn't drink nearly as much and she had gotten her life together, was also. I started to drink way too much, and then at some point I decided to go to a kind of rehab. I stopped drinking and found the joy of life again (for a little while). I applied to university and got to in to study my dream subject. I was sober for years and my studies went almost too well. However, I still wasn't healthy enough to study full time so luckily I got to study as slow as I wanted.I had been diagnosed as having severe depression, dependent personality, and later, after I tried suicide again about 8 years ago, my doctor diagnosed also anxiety disorder and ptsd and prescribed me benzos for my anxiety. I started using benzos everyday, at evenings to take the stress and anxieties away and I'm still using them, even though managed to decrease the amount by 1/3. I was also in therapy for five years. But I'm not writing about the benzos.\n\n\nMy biggest problem now is sleeping med called Zopiclone (brand names Zimovane and Imovane). I started using them also around 2010, and I also used Zolpidem a little. I got these amazing highs from these meds. It felt like my life has a purpose. That my depression, that has been with me for so long that I can remember, was vanished. Everything was so good, and I was good. Now, I still get Zopiclone (Imovane) every 30 days (I'm supposed to use it 1 per night). I still study, in fact I got my BA last year, which was huge for me. And I got an A from my thesis. My studies are going super well, I get good grades mostly but I'm still able to study on my own pace, so I study kinda slow (I try to get better all the time though, it doesn't always go as planned). I have also been cutting myself since I was a teen, but not for a long time expect last autumn I did it again. I am in therapy at the moment with another therapist.\n\n\nBack to Zopiclone. Nowadays when the day comes I can buy it, I'm like child on Christmas. For the past year maybe, I've been taking 4 to even 10 pills in the evening, several hours before going to bed. They do not give me the same feeling as in the beginning, but still they do give me the sweet high, when I'm not anxious or depressed about anything. This way, the 30 pills last only a few days, and after that I get a bit more depressed than usual, because I have to wait for another month for the sweet feeling. I'm also very obese, and benzos seem to make me want to eat a lot, but the sleeping pills makes me not want to eat. Lately, I've been going to deep net in my weakest moments to see, if people sell these pills of mine there, like just before I came to write this. Yes, people sell these but the prices are way out of what I could pay. I feel bad, because I should try to get better in therapy for example, but there's no way I can tell her about this. I'm afraid I wouldn't get these pills after that. I feel like I'm trying to balance myself between the public me everyone thinks I am and between this drug addict, who might do something I'll be regretting forever. I keep fantazising, how my sleeping pills would be given to me as anxiety reliever, because that's what they do to me (even the next morning/day they seem to be working). I have never even tried cannabis/hash/whatever, even though I was offered more than once. Also, I do drink nowadays, but once a week only but too much at once though. Could anyone offer some...I don't know, help? Peer support? What on earth should I do? Sorry for the long post. I've been thinking of writing this for months. Also, English is not my native language, so sorry for any errors. Edit: Sorry, can't get bigger spaces between the paragraphs. Edit 2: I'm 35 years at the moment in case someone wonders\n\nTL;DR Lots of trauma and shit in childhood, severe depression, self harm and suicide attempts, but been getting better little by little, until I got hooked on Zopiclone, which I now misuse.

Mostly stems from depression and anxiety and just getting in the wrong crowd at the wrong time.\n\nI was clean for a while before I met him and for about a year and a half after meeting I was as well. About half a year ago I started going through a really horrible time mentally. I used heroin 5 to 7 times over that period whenever I was crazy sad and angry. I stopped and haven't used in the past 2 months. A couple of weeks ago I let my boyfriend use my phone and he came across some messages from my dealer at the time.\n\nHe got really upset, we didn't talk for a week. It seemed like he hated me for it. And then a week later suddenly he wants to come over and acts super duper nice and sweet. Tells me him being nice doesn't mean he's forgiven me. I understand that and take it for what it is. I told him I will do urine drug tests for him and signed up to see an addiction psychotherapist to hopefully fix what's been broken. All is good, then after a few days he sends me texts saying he doesn't trust me and dissapears again..ignores every attempt I make at talking to him. I know for a fact once the weekend comes around he will suddenly want to see me again and be nice. (He does this when he's mad at me..ghosts me then comes back around)\n\nI don't know what to say to him. I told him I can't stand these mind games. I understand he's angry but I don't think it's fair for him to keep me thinking he's feeling one way and then keeps turning it around.

I texted him saying that but still nothing.\n\nI don't know..should I just let this run its course? I honestly don't think this is a healthy way of dealing with the situation though. It's really hard on me. I wish he would either tell me he doesn't want me in his life or decide he does and work through it with me. This back and forth bullshit just fucks with me emotionally. \n\nTldr; Boyfriend found out I relapsed because my depression was really bad. Got angry and ignored me for a week.

I don't know what to do, what to label myself, or how to go from here.\n\nI could never tell my family I blacked out and lost my phone, they would definitely think I'm an alcoholic because they don't really drink. I'm going to have to lie to them and tell them it was stolen. I'm so ashamed.

The technique thus reduces the danger of secondary addiction to benzodiazepines, which can be a real problem amongst alcoholics who have been treated with these agents.[12]\n\nSodium oxybate\u00a0is the sodium salt of\u00a0gamma-hydroxybutyric acid\u00a0(GHB).

Possible to genuinely care for someone while in active addiction or is your addiction always working it\u2019s way into your mind", "1_text": "The guy I\u2019ve been seeing also happens to have surplus of my current DOC. I met him through a mutual friend. After meeting him a few times we both m wanted to hang out one on one. We did get spun whenever he was there and I was hanging out w this girl. I did know he was the connect for the area. So of course I like the free drugs. I\u2019ve almost always been w the guy who could hook it up bc that\u2019s what I wanted.   \n\nBut the more we hung out the more I really liked him. We end up talking for hours and I can tell he\u2019s surprised by what I know and its refreshing to have someone that understands you without having to spell it all out.  \n\n\n We spent a whole week at his house. The first few days nothing physical happened. We were enamored w each other. Our hands wanted to feel every spot on the others body. The first night we cuddled so completely I didn\u2019t ever want to get up. We slept for almost 12 hrs that night.  \n\n\n Over the rest of the week we generally got along. However, towards the end we began fighting about /having more disagreements.  \n\nThe week went by and by Wednesday we were both ready for some space. Although I felt some kind of codependent whiny voice that didn\u2019t want to leave him or be left. That voice also told me I should make sure I got some to take home w me.   We were intimate and I felt really attracted to him. Yet, we couldn\u2019t look more different. I\u2019m 27 F and he\u2019s 47 [M] while I\u2019m pretty fit and toned he has a little pudge. Not a lot but indicative of his awful eating habits.  \n\nThe second night we were together he and I had a conversation where he shared what he thought when we first met, how he felt safe w me, and natural. I felt the connection. \n\nWe were in agreement. Ultimately each of us dictated around that some rather big steps would have to take in both our lives before we could realistically hope to be together like that.  Now it\u2019s Tuesday am at 5;15. We spent 1week together from Wednesday 17th -24th. At first i didn\u2019t really expect him to call. He didn\u2019t reach out until Saturday afternoon. Texting me. When I called he was w him mom at lunch on Saturday and he would call me when they finished.   \n\nI showed up at his house last night at 11:45. He gave me plenty to take him for free. After I ended up staying that night. It was like I missed him , wanted to see him. I\u2019m sure I wanted to get drugs and knew he had them. But I also felt it was more than that.   \n\nThis morning I left the house at 10am. He made breakfast and gave me plenty to head home w . He said he had some things to take care of and would be coming to my house after. He never called at all anytime on Sunday.\n\nConclusion: Got close with a meth dealer in the last few weeks. I have developed genuine feelings for him. The extent of my feelings is tbd as I haven\u2019t discerned where /what my addiction processes interacted with and melded w my feelings.\n\nAm I just infatuated? What would clarify my feelings as either being compassionate toward him or indicative of my own selfish addict thinking? \n\nHe seems to care. At times. I\u2019d like to talk to him or hear his perspective. How could I approach the topic w him? \n\nPlease be honest and tell me like it is. I realize this is a bit of a mess.

Run like he's an axe murderer. Because as a meth addict, dating a meth dealer is essentially the same thing.  I don't know if you have any desire to get clean yet, but dating a drug dealer is going in the opposite direction of clean.\n\nNow look, no judgement here, I promise, but this is the honest truth:\n\nYou asked if the addiction is always going to screw with you, and I will say no... but only because it's not the addiction itself that is screwing with you, it's the issues you have that led you into addiction in the first place. Drug abuse and addictions in general are a way you escape your real life, a way to numb and medicate your pain. And whatever those issues are are also going to lead you to become attracted to all the wrong sorts of people. So it's not your addiction working against you, it's *you*.  And that totally sucks.  And it doesn't mean you're a bad person, it just means you've got some serious baggage that needs to be worked out so you can be mentally and emotionally healthy.  And you're never going to get there dating drug dealers, or really dating anybody your brain says you should date, at least until you've gotten clean and been through some therapy.\n\nI don't doubt you had a connection. I don't doubt you really like him, and maybe he really likes you too. But screwed up people attract each other, that's how it works. \n\nWhat you really need right now is to get clean, to go to rehab and/or NA meetings, get a sponsor, start letting them do all your thinking for you and you just keep doing what they tell you for a few months, even if you hate it. Because your own best thinking got you addicted to meth and dating a dealer.  Is that the life you imagined for yourself? Is it really the life you want for yourself now?\n\nYou deserve better than that. I'm sure you've had some serious crap happen in your life for you to end up here and plenty of it isn't your fault (and plenty of it probably is, and that's OK too, because you can sort it out).\n\nBut right now, I don't see anything about wanting to get off drugs, I just see a broken person (again, no judgement, we're all broken in our own ways) who is dealing with her pain in terrible ways, one of them by getting into relationships with men who are only going to cause more pain. And so if you are just wondering if it's OK to date a drug dealer because you think maybe the age and weight difference is a bit off... well, you're thinking about all the wrong things right now.

When I wrote that question I was very aware of my wording and sure to write it in a way that my \u2018question\u2019 would be rather obvious after reading the whole thing.\n\nThe issue there (well 1) is I\u2019d start w one thing in my head. After writing that down I discount that almost immediately because it didn\u2019t make the problem clear enough, made it too clear (to even pretend I have question.) and/or complicated the issue by providing extraneous content.\n\nTaking hours to type up a question about a relationship, as in this case, causes me to seriously ask myself what the purpose for writing the question was initially. I had to mince everything down so much it\u2019s not even reflective of the relationship. What I could share w you and use for a Question would underscore the need for me to get the fuck over this.\n\nSo, from reading your response it\u2019s like my head has cleared and a weight lifted off my shoulders. Not because that was the first time I\u2019d heard that or received confirmation of my own doubts, but more so due to the way you presented each point. Added some emphasis and stern advice as needed. While you didn\u2019t tiptoe around it or say I was just screwed entirely, you replied in a way that reminds me of a good no-sense friend from recovery, or sponsor, without being pushy \n\nOkay what I have decided is that there will not be a round 2 with this guy. I already dealt w opiate withdrawals etc. have spent so much everything to get from 120mg of methadone to 10mg where I am now. I made a mistake w meth. But I won\u2019t do it again. I know without a doubt it would only cause further issues w the gamily, my loved ones/friends /and it would be like me just giving up on any kind of life I care to live.\n\nSaying that now hits home.

When I was binging w homeboy i couldn\u2019t get anywhere for anything.

Things I\u2019ve always loved and have never failed to excite. That in itself was enough to make me take note that whatever I was feeling was temporary and in time I could get back to where I was before. If I stopped now. \n\nI started doing meth 11/1/17 have had a few binges in there  . through now, thus I can repair as much as I can and that will only increasingly get worse.\nSo I have what I have. Which may just end up being stashed or thrown as I can\u2019t do it all week. That\u2019s only good bc I won\u2019t end calling him\nOr these two other chicks I know could\nHelp bc they\u2019re all bad news bears. \n\nOver the next few days I\u2019m going to adjust myself back into daily routine where I go to he gym for even 5 minutes. Drink coffee. Breakfast, find a job.\n\nNow if this prolongs itself in some way that makes me See I\u2019ll need help doing this and I\u2019ll either talk to my mom or go to treatment.\n\nI know that\u2019s a bit naive. My DOC has always been downers /opiates. May not have demonstrated this most recently. Yet I am able to have them without being overwhelmed to keep taking more.

I was a high school senior from St. Louis excited to start a new journey at the University of Missouri - Columbia. I had been smoking weed and drinking off and on and occasionally taking xanax here and there. By no means did I ever think I had a problem. I got to college and my drug and alcohol use increased. I smoked everyday, I drank everyday, I did coke everyday, and I popped pills everyday, all in an effort to prove I could hang in there and do these things like everyone else, like it was a normal thing. I found that people would actually have to keep up with me. It was all a game to me and never once did I think I had a problem. I could smoke a blunt, pop 4 xans, and then drop $60 at the bar like it was nothing. Did I remember my nights? Hell no. But I didnt regret it. \n\nIn February of 2017, my cousin committed suicide, swallowing an entire bottle of benzos. This is when my usage turned from trying to have fun, to covering up my pain. I didnt go out to bars to get fucked up, I sat at home and did it. My xanax usage spiked to 6-8 a day just so I wasnt sick from withdrawals. I still never thought I had a problem. My attendance in class was almost non-existent, and I dropped out of Mizzou. \n\nI continued to pop pills all summer, even living in my parents house. They knew I had a problem but I didnt. I was spending up to $80 a day on just xanax that I could never account for when I was asked about it. I went through my days as a zombie, going to work, eating bars, sleeping, and repeating. \n\nBy the fall, I weighed 120 lbs as a 6'2\" male. I was malnurished and rarely ate anything. I popped pills all day and brought myself back to life with coke to wake me up. All this time, I thought I was normal and I had no problems. \n\nAround Thanksgiving of 2017, I had lost my job and couldve given less fucks. I was living in my parents basement, pawning off all of my possessions and even taking their TV to buy pills. I took a turn for the worst when a dealer of mine introduced me to heroin. I had always told myself I would never touch needles, but my morals meant nothing, and I shot up. Day after day I continued this routine, getting deeper and deeper into the clutches of my addiction. \n\nOn Thanksgiving day, I had popped 4 xans and done a shot of dope before coming up to the dinner table, where I proceeded to nod off and slur my words in front of my entire family. I blacked out and have no recollection of the day. \n\nOn November 25th, 2017, I woke up in a rehab facility in a small town of 400 people about 2 hours outside of St. Louis. That day, I threw up everything in my body and had a seizure all in one. I got taken to the hospital, where I realized that I did have a problem. That first week in detox wasnt pretty. I was dope sick everyday, couldnt eat, and couldnt sleep. I was miserable. About 2 weeks in, I made it to my first group session. \n\nThe session was an NA meeting, held in rehab center, where a guest was invited from nearby Bowling Green, Missouri to talk to us clients about addiction. I'll never forget that man. He had 31 years sober and still struggled with his sobriety everyday. He said it wouldnt be easy, but it was worth it. He preached that no high was better than experiencing the joys of life like seeing your first born child for the first time or getting married to the love of your life. He was right. \n\nI spent 50 days in that rehab center and it saved my life. Now, I am 65 days clean and feeling amazing. I am WELL aware that I am very early in this journey and certainly have a long way to go. But being only 19 years old, I can only see the positives that have come with saving my life. \n\nI have gained 30 lbs and have an appetite once again. I have continuously rebuilt trust with my family that I never thought could be fixed. I am dealing with stress in healthy ways that dont involve using substances. I have re-enrolled in school and actually enjoy learning again. My knowledge on addiction only grows and I educate myself everyday on the dangers of substance abuse. I continue to go to Intensive Outpatient as an aftercare group from my stay in a rehabilitation facility. I also attend either Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous every day as a way of community support. \n\nBeing surrounded by recovering addicts and hearing their stories has given me the tools and the courage to continue my fight.\n\nFor all young adults in recovery or battling addiction, YOU CAN DO IT. I was in your spot, in that dark place all by yourself, and it sucks.

As far back as I can remember, I\u2019ve had obsession after obsession.  These obsessions could be over something I collected or a song I\u2019d fall in love with or just anything I decided I loved.  When my mind focused on something, it was impossible for me to even consider that where was a whole world around me with infinite other things to spread my energy and efforts to.  There was never more than one or two things, and that\u2019s all I had time for.  All that being said, I don\u2019t have many memories from my childhood.  I remember where I was in my mind, but look at pictures of events in my life and have absolutely no idea why they exist.  I\u2019ve somehow blocked it all out.\n\tWhen I was 16 or so, I started losing my friends to accidents, overdoses, and suicides.  You can imagine that going to two funerals of close friends within the period of a month can cause some pain for a kid.  The deaths still continued from there.   Every adult I knew talked about how they had never seen something like this from a single circle of teenagers.  It shocked everyone really.  Incidentally, I ended up in therapy where I was given a generous dose of Paxil.  This was accompanied by Diazapam and Xanax for anxiety.  I had never felt better\u2026until the day I had never felt worse.  These days took turns mercilessly on me and could have caused me to take my life on one of the bad ones.  I\u2019ll be forever thankful to my ex partner for helping me get off of them when I was 22.  It was extremely difficult, but with such a strong support system, I worked hard to end my dependence on this terrible drug I had been on for so long.  \n\tBack to my addiction.  I\u2019m now 30 years old, and I\u2019ve just realized I\u2019m addicted to absolutely everything that creates a spike of Dopamine to make me feel good.  I\u2019m addicted to anything that makes me feel better than I did the moment before.  I\u2019m addicted to YouTube, and the constant variety at my fingertips.  Knowing that one click can lead me on a journey of more interesting clicks.  I\u2019m addicted to food like cookies, but I\u2019ll never let anyone notice.  I\u2019ll buy them and hide them until I\u2019ve eaten them.  I\u2019m addicted to drugs.  Living in Amsterdam, drugs are always a quick text away.  You know there are literally delivery services here who somehow operate easily around the law?  I can text for a menu, and have 30-35 different options.  Pick your drug.  The drug I found myself doing most often was GHB.  Ironically, I don\u2019t like to drink alcohol at all, so GHB became what I did to catch up to speed with my friends when they were drinking.  Whatever it was that I was doing, I easily justified it to myself and never realized I had done some sort of drug every day.  If it wasn\u2019t a drug, it was food.  I managed to do well in my job, and I worked out every day.  I was also vegetarian, so that\u2019s a couple of points for taking care of myself and I thought that was ok.  \n\tMy partner of almost 6 years, for some reason, stood by me longer than most people would.  We loved each other and he was my travel companion, but I was inconsiderate.  I wasn\u2019t romantic or even thoughtful.  Rarely did I do something special for him, and he went out of his way to make me feel good.  He knew I had a tough hand dealt to me from the beginning, so I think he gave me a lot of slack.  It still wasn\u2019t right though.  He and I broke up a year and a half ago.  We still talk, and of course we care about each other, but I\u2019ve done too much damage for our relationship to ever be completely mended.  I\u2019ll always love him for taking such good care of his emotionally unstable boyfriend though.  He really saved my life.  The reason I tell you about this breakup is because it was the event that escalated my use of drugs over the last two years.  My ex tried to sit me down and talk about it several times before we officiallybroke up.  He was gentle about it, and approached it delicately.  I dismissed it quickly every time, thinking he was attacking me.  I guess this is what addicts do.  \n\tOne year after our breakup, things got really bad for me.  I hadn\u2019t been working in a few months because of some health problems, and I was in a really deep state of depression.  I had pushed all of my friends away, and had never felt so alone.  My ex realized how bad I was, so he checked in with me almost every day.  Almost every day, I didn\u2019t answer him.  I was so deep in my depression I didn\u2019t want to talk to him, which I regret terribly.  \n\tRock Bottom.  That\u2019s what they say you have to reach before you can go up\u2026 I did it.  Amsterdam\u2019s Gay Pride Festival is one of the most anticipated weekends of the summer here.  Everyone gets involved, and there are parties the entire week.  I decided this year to not make plans that I would most likely get crossed with other plans.  I decided just to walk out my door and see where I ended up and who I would see.  This plan worked great.  I ran into one group of friends after another, and I was never alone.  The only problem was that I didn\u2019t have one single person that stayed with me the whole time to know where I had already been and what drugs I had done.  The lack of a babysitter, and my lack of self control led me to stay awake and party from Friday night until Tuesday afternoon.  I hadn\u2019t slept or eaten more than maybe a banana.  I don\u2019t know how I lasted so long.  If I\u2019m being truthful, I had decided that I wouldn\u2019t live past the Pride weekend.  I decided I was going to be just another accidental overdose on a party weekend, and that no one would know it was my choice.  I guess I kept partying to push back ending everything with a little too much of something.  Tuesday afternoon, after all the partying, I ended up at a guy\u2019s house.  We met the week before and he invited me over, not knowing I had been going hard for nearly four days.  He could see there was something seriously wrong and immediately became a caregiver.  He made  me a smoothie, rolled a joint, and made sure I was comfortable and could sleep.  He had no real reason at all to be so good to me, but he was.  He\u2019s now another person I consider to have saved my life.  He looked after me for several days, and after that we continued hanging out every single day.  It wasn\u2019t romantic, but very affectionate in a cuddly friends sort of way.  It felt nice.  I\u2019ve been sober since that Tuesday, by the way.\n\tNow that my life had been saved again, spirituality began to play a huge role in my recovery.  Without going too far into my personal beliefs, I\u2019ll say that I had an awakening of sorts.  I\u2019ve become more aware of myself and have found a profound sense of empathy toward others.  I\u2019m understanding more and more every day that meditation and certain practices can really elevate you to accept more positive things from the universe.  I can honestly say that, for the first time in my life, I\u2019m beginning to feel what I think normal should feel like.  \n\tFast forward to two months ago, and I discovered microdosing.  Microdosing is taking about 1/10 of a normal dose of a psychedelic substance on a regular basis.  I do this with Psilocybin mushrooms, and I take 0.10 gram every three days.  This amount isn\u2019t enough to make you high, but it does make the day a little better.  It elevates mood, relieves anxiety, promotes creativity, and makes every day just a really good day.  It puts me in a flow state, where everything just seems to work out.  I\u2019m more of a \u201cglass half full\u201d person all of a sudden, and I feel a stronger connection to nature and to the people I love.  I appreciate everything more.  Whereas antidepressants just made me high and terminally happy, only to make me crash eventually, microdosing doesn\u2019t have this effect.  It works like serotonin, but also starts connecting parts of one\u2019s brain that aren\u2019t normally communicating.  In fact, I\u2019ve never felt like writing anything in my entire life, but for some reason I feel compelled right now to share this.  \n\tI don\u2019t think the mental states I\u2019ve endured are anything special.  In fact, I think it\u2019s far more common than most of us realize.  I think we need to normalize communication about these things, and be open about mental health.  I don\u2019t think most of my friends have a clue I\u2019ve lived my life so tortured.  I was very good at hiding it.  As a hospitality professional, I\u2019m a trained actor capable of fooling anyone with a fake smile.  Today, my smiles are very real.  I find myself smiling because I walk past a bakery that smells amazing.  I smile when I see children and animals.  I like cats all of a sudden\u2026I\u2019ve always hated cats.  I think my life is truly bringing me balance.  \n\tI\u2019ve been sober for six months now, but I\u2019m still an addict.  I\u2019m working on it every day, but I will say that I\u2019m not worried about falling back.  I am on a bright path of light and love, and am finding myself happy.  I don\u2019t know what I expect for this letter, but I thank you for reading my ramblings.  I\u2019m going to sleep now\u2026happy \n\t\t\n", "2_timestamp": "2018-02-01 00:14:18", "3_author": "bearekrawr", "comments": [{"DimeBagJoe2": [{"dtlgvpj": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-02-01 16:36:18", "1_text": "I know cannabis and heroin are 2 extremely different things, but have you tried smoking weed to distract your mind when you try going clean?

Ditch reading the reddit posts about addiction.  don't read about depression.

Instead, read reddit posts about things like NOFAP, meditation, spirituality, positivity, health, and ways to improve your overall well being.

By reading things like this, I was actually preparing myself with mental tools, and ways to noticeably feel \"well\".  I know a lot of people are helped in really positive ways on the blogs about whatever disorders or addiction we have, BUT I think by reading these, sometimes you're using too much energy comparing your situation to others and always thinking about your situation.  It just reiterates negativity over and over.  I feel like this was a lot to say a little, but I hope it made sense.  Read again the things I listed off that I've been reading about...join the subs for those too.  The NOFAP sub is incredible and super supportive, and the spirituality and health subs are great too.  Try to start practicing with one and give it a few days....once you start to feel a bit good one day, you suddenly feel the energy to add more positives.

I drank & drugged for a good 15 yrs of my life, always struggling with the want to be \"normal\". You should know what I had to learn was, this isn't our fault exactly. There are 2 types of people on our planet: the blessed type that can take a drink or an opiate here or there and never have a craving for more. And then there are those of us that are basically destined to become addicts. I have been an addict for so long, no matter how hard I tried to stay clean. No matter how badly I wanted to be a different sort of person, I couldn't. I went over the same arguments that you are about suboxone/subutex being just a bandaid on a really deep wound: swapping one addiction for another. But that's not what this is. First of all, it's a step in a process. It's meant to be taken for months or a couple years, so that it can do it's job. My doctor told me that it slowly heals the receptors in your brain that crave drugs. Also, it's LEGAL! Personally, I do not miss sneaking and lying and hussling to take care of an insatiable habit, all the while worried that I could go to jail if I got caught. I feel my brain healing. My memory is way better than it was a year ago. My speech has improved. My skin has healed and my dermatologist told me this week that I had the complexion of a 15yr old kid-what?! (I'm 43f). I can hold down a job and won't be worried about being fired if I have to take a drug test. I have healthy relationships with my bf and my family and friends. I have energy. I have my wits about me and make healthy decisions. Also, I have seen 2 other people at my doctor's office whom I knew from my shady past. Both of these people were dealers and by all rights, should not be alive...but they are because they made the same choice I did. I tell everyone about the suboxone program because I fully believe it saves lives and brains and personalities. It's a no-brainer. If you are an addict, this is a great step in the right direction. I haven't met anyone who regrets getting on this medication and I hope you get some help, because life is hard as an addict...and it doesn't have to be!

I have lost family members to both substance use disorder and other mental illnesses.

While many people \"blame\" individuals who use substances, I do not. I feel very sympathetic and have a deep understanding of what leads individuals to use substances, and I do not judge people for that. What I am trying to find out is if adverse childhood experiences and insecure attachment styles are related to negative life outcomes. This is especially important given that adverse childhood experiences and insecure attachment are not developed by choice of the child whatsoever. People are often disadvantaged because of their childhood, but judged so harshly as if they have chosen to take such a hard path into addiction.

Fentanyl is active in the microgram range, which is an amount the human eye could not possibly see. When dealing with amounts that small, it's more than easy when pressing fentanyl pills or tabs to accidentally put a 2x or 3x dose in a single pill. This has led to many deaths as inexperienced opiate users are sold \"oxys\" or \"xanax\" that are really just fentanyl pressed into a counterfeit pill. This is how Lil Peep died, if you've been following current events recently. I've lost 3 friends in the last 6 months to fentanyl. It's devastating stuff.

All of my life I remember being extremely unhappy, for reasons unbeknownst to me. I was just constantly bored in school. The course material in classes have always been a joke to me, taking little effort to do well. Of course, when junior high rolls around I made some friends that were into percs and xans. I started to take those in the back of classrooms with my little squad of fools. After class, we'd of course just go rail adderall in the bathroom, pretty much creating a speedball effect. So I was really young to be using that many drugs, and I went a little crazy and ended up in a psychiatric hospital for a couple weeks. That was when I was 14 after my freshman year of high school. Even with all the drug use I still maintained a 4.0 GPA my freshman year, so of course when I got out of the hospital I saw no real reason to stop. My parents drug tested me for a time so I couldn't really use, until they stopped testing me towards the end of my sophomore year. I immediately started using again and even got addicted to spice(wtf) for a period, along with the usual heavy pill use and smoking. The beginning of my junior year, I was told I need to go to counselor and make some scheduling changes due to some of the courses I was enrolled in being cancelled by the school. When I got to her office, she informed me that because of the HS credits I got in junior high I could graduate that year with honors and even a semester of college done. So I changed my schedule for that, eager to leave home and make it on my own. You see the drugs have never changed my motivation, even to this day. At the same time I made the decision to leave early I made some alphabay orders on the deep web, and bought 25i-nbome(psychedelic, very similar to LSD to an untrained user, is dosed onto blotter paper just like acid is, except it's much cheaper). The price was $40 dollars a sheet(a sheet is 100 hits). I loved LSD, I had not done the nbome yet, but had read great things, so I eagerly ordered two sheets with my business partner. In our area that was dry of psychedelics, we had no problem selling 10 strips to pot dealers at $80, a price that they eagerly accepted considering the lack of acid like drugs in the region. So we were selling $4 worth of the shit for $80. Life was pretty good at the time if you haven't put that together by now. We stopped buying sheets, and started buying pages. We had set up connections to push our shit in lots of nearby towns and the money was coming all directions. We also had 1000s of stockpile hits of acid, so of course I was taking like 5 hits a day. Fast-forward - shit gets hot as hell with the police and I decide to quit dealing before I inevitably got popped. I graduated that year at 17, summa cum laude. I noticed that I was hearing things that others were not, and that I felt the constant presence of people behind me, even when no one was there. I became paranoid and my eating habits got shitty. I became thin as hell. My hair grew to a Legolas-like length. OF COURSE, no one in my life notices anything is wrong. For whatever reason, whatever I do just ends in getting praised for being so smart or handsome. Paranoia and hallucinations that led to weight loss(I was already skinny before), weren't met with concerns, just people telling me I should be a high fashion model with cheekbones and hair like that. I smile when people say that. On the inside I'm trying to build up the courage to ask for help. When people see you as person with the whole world in front of them, they think you're bitching if you have any issues. So I continue on like everything is okay. And eventually I get myself clean for the first year of college, but trying this on my own, I crumble and start using again. I've been at college for two years now. And have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. I'll be graduating a semester or two early. Last semester I didn't Dean's List. I didn't put enough effort in, funnily enough it was the same effort I always put in. I realized I'm not a fucking mastermind like I thought. And that I'm an irresponsible idiot who just gets high as fuck all day and scrapes by. I always get myself clean for a period and then fucking start getting high and blowing my money on designer clothes and partying, andddd somehow I end up back in the psychiatric hospital. I just wanna be fucking normal like fuckin' a' man will I ever be able to beat this shit? Is it just ingrained in me at this point? I've never had any real consequences and I fear that in coming years that everything around me will crumble to the ground :/ I'm pretty sure I'll kill myself or be dead in the next three years anyway. I'm such a fucking waste of potential. I became a Mensa International member at 12 only to be a 19 year old who looks like a blend of Legolas and a soundcloud rapper, and can't even formulate a proper sentence because the language center in his brain is fucking fried from drug use.

I don't recommend trying the opposite of that haha. \n\nHonestly the first thing you should do is try and fulfill what you said seemed missing. Allocate study time to catch up in school, and make effort to socialize more. You will still have plenty of free time after those two goals are completed though, where you will likely want to game. So the natural response is to find another hobby to fill that gap. Maybe even a productive hobby or one that fulfills you on an intellectual or artistic level. You could start exercising or power-lifting? You could pick up writing, drawing, painting, or maybe even music production. The hardest part of quitting anything is the idle time in between responsibilities, as you instinctively chose to go back to what you know when presented with no reason not to. So I'd recommend focusing on getting your priorities straight, putting school and friends above anything, and then find something that you a passion in and get \"addicted\" to it. Video games are called an addiction because the constant indulgence of them doesn't produce any gain only takes dollars out of your pockets. Someone who produces 10 beats a day isn't a music addict because there are sharp benefits to the mind from making music and possibly even monetary gain(however, unlikely), and it gives you a real sense of achievement, more importantly than anything else.

Lately, his behavior involving alcohol has become a problem. Whatever happens in our lives affects both family and work, so I'm concerned not only for my brother's health, but also for my family's financial future. This is kind of long, but hopefully it makes sense when I'm done.\n\nBack in April of last year, my brother left his wife. He moved into an apartment in the same town and started going out to the bars a lot. Leading up to the split, his drinking had become more regular, but it was mostly at night while playing video games and didn't affect his work so no one thought much of it. After the split, he started having issues getting to work on time. His girlfriend confided in me that he was up drunk texting her at 5am one morning when he missed a safety meeting.\n\nAround September or October of last year, I got a call around midnight. He was at a concert and was certain someone stole his truck. He had been all over the parking lot and couldn't find it. I drove an hour to the venue to find him hammered out of his mind in the wrong parking lot. The truck was parked on the opposite side of the building. I told him it wasn't stolen and that I was taking him home and would come retrieve the truck later. He spent the entire ride home begging me and shouting at my to take him back and let him drive back. He'd \"driven way more drunk and never hit anything before.\"\n\nIn early November he and his girlfriend had split up and he decided to try to work things out with his wife. They had a friendsgiving party and invited the worst possible guests. My brother's very recent ex-girlfriend and her husband, who she'd been married to the entire time. He had no idea she had been cheating on him. And they came. And things got ugly. By 10:30 both my brother and his wife were slobbering drunk. My brother needed to pee, but the bathroom was occupied, so he went outside to pee in the yard. He somehow fell and ended up sleeping out there for what everyone figured was probably about 20 minutes. Once we got him back inside, a shouting match ensued between him and his wife about his drinking and his having slept with another girl while they were still married. Everyone quickly excused themselves for the night.\n\nSeveral uncomfortable family functions and a few more missed days of work later, he tells me he crashed the company truck into some construction barrels driving drunk, but only put scratches on the truck so it's fine. He assured me that this was the wakeup call he needed and that he hasn't had a drink in two weeks. Apparently the drinking also was bothering the ex girlfriend. I was relieved until tonight.\n\nI've been worried about his abuse issues for months and have had several conversations with him about them. He's always admitted that drinking was causing problems in his life, but that he liked it because it made all the anger he felt towards his wife and the guilt he feels towards his son and our company go away for a while.\n\nTonight I got a call from him. He said his wife was in a lot of pain and wanted to know if we had any strong painkillers in the house. I asked why he needed them from me and he said because he didn't want to have to go to the ER to get her some. He had already called another friend of ours who is a pharmacy technician and asked her to get him some for her and was told no. I was his last resort. I got very angry and told him if she needed pain meds, the doctor is where to get them and he needed to stop asking people to put themselves in jeopardy over it. He's now pissed at me.\n\nUnder normal circumstances I would have considered it, but with all the abuse issues in the past few months, this seemed like a scheme to get high, not a need for actual medicine. I think it's time to start dealing with this like a serious addiction issue, but I'm not really sure where you start.

She stood by me while I went through rehab and things have been going great until four months ago. My old dealer ended up coming into my place of business and I ended up giving him my phone number.

I was having major anxiety on the way home from work yesterday about going into wd's over night so I stopped and bought some kratom on the way home.

I know its just trading one substance for another and after reading the sub on wd's I'm scared of getting hooked on it as well.

She told me when I first signed up that we would wean me off sometime in the future because it's not meant to be a long-term solution. I was taking a few opiates here and there before that, and was hoping to wean off those, but then got to the point that I could barely work due to pain (sucks getting old). My suggestion for you, if you're not taking the opiates for pain, is to get on a low dose of subs and go on a weaning schedule in a couple months. It's a better plan than trying to control weaning yourself off opiates imo. Also, lose dude's number like yesterday. That temptation must get lost. At first, I was really frustrated to be trading one addiction for another. But I feel in control because of being under the care of a physician who I can be transparent with. And I do feel as though they are healing my brain. And the longer I'm away from hustling, the stronger new, healthier habits are set in my psyche. Idk man, being an addict is a crapshoot every day, but I know that I have faith in my doctor and this system, and that says a lot. I trust her to wean me at an appropriate time for me. My weaning will have to coincide with other doctors getting my arthritis under control with shots, surgeries etc. All I know is that I recommend subs to anyone struggling because, at the very least, they help give you a grip and a starting point.

How should I get off this shit?", "1_text": "So I have a serious problem with kratom, a legal drug that feels just like opiates. I decided recently that I need to quit ASAP. I\u2019m playing with fire here; addiction is a slippery slope to some real suffering. What I\u2019d like to know is whether physical addiction has already begun to take hold on me, or if it is just my mind playing tricks. This will inform how I will go about getting off the junk. \n\nSome details:    \nTowards the beginning of September, I started using kratom on weekends. I would always take 6 grams, which is the high end of common. It\u2019s the maximum dose recommended for pain management in the completely opiate naive, but lower than what a full blown addict takes. I steadily began using more and more during the week, and by the end of December, I was using everyday. Since then, so for a little over a month, I\u2019ve been taking 6 gram per day, a couple hours before bed. But even after all this time, I still don\u2019t have any noticeable tolerance; 6 grams is still plenty.    \nHere\u2019s the reason why I think I may be physically addicted. Although I feel completely normal and healthy during the day, at night I get very uncomfortable and anxious until I take some kratom. The other night I forced myself to skip it and I felt empty and depressed. Furthermore, I was irritable the entire next day. I\u2019m not getting any stomach cramps, nausea, or diarrhea, which I know are some hallmarks of opiate withdrawal. However, I did have a runny nose today, and since my dose it has dried up. (This may just be a coincidence though. My roommate has a cold that I\u2019m probably just catching...)\n\nSo my question is do I have mild physical dependence or am I just severely psychologically addicted. If it is physical, I think I will let myself ween of it gradually. If not, I will go cold turkey. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Should I ween of either way? Cold turkey either way? I\u2019d love some guidance here. This is very difficult for me, and I can\u2019t really talk about it with anyone... thanks in advance", "2_timestamp": "2018-02-07 05:16:58", "3_author": "laughs_at_things_", "comments": [{"KeepsMakingMistakes": [{"dtuy7ty": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-02-06 21:36:47", "1_text": "A little bit of both.

She began to explain \u201cnick said he was going to dinner and shopping with you....we lost him last night\u201d I was in shock. I couldn\u2019t speak. I couldn\u2019t ask how, what or why. She thanked me for being who I was and how I provided this best things in his life. We hung up the phone, I lost my shit. I spent the last FIVE years of my life off and on with this guy. FIVE years completely gone and they aren\u2019t coming back. \n\nNick had struggled with a very brief but intense crack cocaine addiction early on in 2017. He hit rock bottom and his parents and even I played tough love. He voluntarily checked himself into rehab in Texas. Where he stayed from August until November.. he wasn\u2019t supposed to leave until January He came home the week of thanksgiving feeling really really good about himself. I was hopeful but I was concerned. The minute he got his phone back (October) he texted me wanting to know if I wanted to be with him when he got home I told him if he remained clean and sober then yes. I feel like this was a massive contributor to him leaving treatment early and coming home. He looked to me for just about all of his support.  \n\nSince he was home I didn\u2019t see or suspect any drug use. Nor did his parents. \n\nI went to his family\u2019s home the day after he passed away. I saw his brother in the driveway and all I could do is say how. He went on to explain that Nick turned his phone off when he said he was going out with me. That\u2019s when he must\u2019ve gone to get drugs. He later overdosed in the bathroom and was found by his poor mother who is the absolute sweetest woman you\u2019d ever meet. The cause of death at this point wasn\u2019t known. As I was there, the ME called to notify the cause of death was a fentanyl overdose. He had snorted an oxy that happened to be cut with fentanyl. The ME explained, he was essentially poisoned and died instantly. I saw his parents break in front of me. I saw their tears, their screams, that look on their face. I\u2019ll never get it out of my head. \n\nSeeing his parents talking about him and his character and looking to me for affirmation was probably the greatest honor I\u2019ll ever have. His dad looking right at me and talking about how awesome of a person he was and saying \u201cwasn\u2019t he nicole?\u201d  Being in his house was so hard. He wasn\u2019t there and it was the same place that he died. All I wanted to do is lay in his bed or even sit on the floor where his body was found. All I wanted to know was what was it like. All I want to know is why and how did we get to this point. \n\nI still talk with his family. We text, we\u2019re friends on Facebook. All of our friends have reached out to me in some way. They all say the same thing, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine your pain\u201d no, you can\u2019t. This is THE hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to face. I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone.

I never thought in a million years I\u2019d be that grieving girlfriend. I constantly look at myself and wonder if I let him down. He told me to keep him away from the drugs and I let him down. I didn\u2019t do that. \n\nFor days I pictured his body in a freezer and on the autopsy table. When he was laid to rest, all I could think about is oh my god, he is in the ground. I\u2019ve wanted to dig him up. I want to just shake his lifeless body and tell him to wake up but I know he\u2019s gone and never coming back.

I wish I knew what was going through your mind that night I wish you would have said something. I\u2019m still waiting for someone to wake me up from this nightmare and say it isn\u2019t true. I\u2019m still waiting for you to blow up my phone with texts saying \u201chi babe! I\u2019m fine, what are you doing later!?\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll never forget all the times we had together. All of the times you gave me \u201cthat look\u201d and I had to tell you to be nice. All the times you made fun of me every chance you got..you were ruthless and you got me good sometimes! All the complaining you did about my driving and your exaggerating moves every time I hit the brakes (even though we both know you were the worst driver known to man). All of the times you made fun of me for my 100 baths a day and brushing my teeth every chance I got. I couldn\u2019t even pee without you bothering me in some way or jiggling the door handle a thousand times! All the times you said something and I gave you the crazy what are you talking about look and you\u2019d just sit there with that smile trying not to laugh. All the times I yelled at you for staring at me, taking my phone, poking me, stepping on my feet and whatever else you did to be a pain and every single time you still wouldn\u2019t stop you just laughed at me. Oh and your singing..dear god it was horrible but oh what I\u2019d do to hear you sing love the way you lie just one more time. I\u2019ll never forget the time we were in the grocery store fighting over bread and who was paying for my stuff. The cashier laughed so hard and said we were worse than the married couples he sees. Let\u2019s not forget PJs... I told you I\u2019d never let you live that down ugh I\u2019ve never been so mad at you! I also really wish I saved all of those napkins you autographed for me oh and the one where you attempted to explain the stock market! NYE with you was truly special and I\u2019m so glad I spent it with you.  We could have gone out and had a good time but instead we decided to just stay in at your house talking and laughing in your bed. I would take another night like this over a party any day. I\u2019ll never forget you stopping me in mid sentence yelling wait and jumping out of bed running to the tv to dance when it hit 2018 you were so happy about it. 2018 was going to be your year. Every time I begin feeling sad, I watch that atrocious video I took of you on NYE. I laugh so hard every time and it brings the biggest smile to my face it sums up your wild goofy side so well. I\u2019ll forever eat chicken parm thinking about that time when you tried getting me to sneak one in my purse for you at the movies. \n\nWhat I would do right now just to have you snoring in my ears and mouth breathing on my face as I lay in rage wide awake. Who would have ever thought I\u2019d miss that? I bitched at you throughout the night and every morning for it. It\u2019s the little things. There\u2019s so so many things I\u2019ll miss about you. I could sit here and write all day about you and the times we had and planned to have together. You were the biggest (but best) pain in my ass and you took great pride in that! You knew all the right buttons to push. You knew exactly what to say to me. You knew exactly want I wanted and needed at all times. I always joked about us essentially being the same person but I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. \n\nI spent time with your family yesterday, we had lots of laughs lots of tears but we\u2019ll be okay knowing you\u2019re okay now. They all gave me so much comfort even though it was my first time meeting many of them so so so many hugs. I\u2019ll forever be grateful to your parents to allow me to spend those moments with them their kind words will stay with me forever. I promised your dad I will always still talk to you. Your parents are SO strong. Yesterday was the closure that I needed and it will give me the strength to move on. I\u2019m happy to know you\u2019re at peace and okay. Please watch over me. If I ever win that lottery we talked about, I promise to do all the things we planned on doing. The past five years of having you in my life were an honor.

I began to just ACT without any or all prior thought, all to please people and have them laugh at my expense.

Its been 123 days since i took my last psychedelic drug, and its been a very unstable taper off. At first, i was tripping for about two weeks straight (as the last dose i took was 1mg LSD paired with 200mg DXM).

My family all live overseas so it\u2019s generally not that difficult for me to keep my drug & alcohol useage a secret from them. \n\nOver the weekend after a particularly heavy session, I started getting severe chest pains and had tremendous difficulty breathing. I\u2019ve never even been to a casualty ward or emergency room in my life due to a lifelong fear of hospitals. However, the pain and breathing got so bad yesterday evening that out of sheer panic I knew I had to get myself to the nearest one, it was the first time in my life I was actually frightened for my health. I honestly thought I was dying, or at least very seriously ill.\n\nMy years of drug fuelled isolation had really come back to haunt me, I\u2019ve never felt so scared, so miserable or so lonely as I did last night. When I finally got to the hospital I had to endure a long wait to see a doctor. My chest pains had gradually eased over the hours, but I was still struggling when it was time to see the doctor. When I told her I had a drug addiction, all sympathy, and compassion quickly disappeared from her face. She spent the rest of the time looking at me like I was something she\u2019d scraped off her shoe. Then she mumbled something about an infection / nothing she could do / take some tylenol etc. 24hrs later, I still have chest pains and difficulty breathing, but nowhere near as severe as yesterday.\n\nI got home in the small hours looking (and feeling) like I\u2019d been sleeping under a bridge for a week. The whole experience really brought home the need to make some drastic changes. I\u2019ve spent the day reflecting on just how fucking terrible my life really has become. I don\u2019t go out, all my friends just stopped bothering with me and there is no prospect of a girl on the horizon. I\u2019m probably going to get fired from my job and my relationship with my family has become more and more distant. I look at myself in the mirror everyday and see myself getting greyer, fatter and looking closer to 52 than 32. I think I always just assumed that eventually I would meet someone, straighten my life out and settle down into being a grown up. But the years are really starting to tumble by, and instead I feel like I\u2019m permanently trapped in this fucking life, going nowhere.

In fact, the only reason I\u2019m posting this story is because it\u2019s the closest thing I have to someone to talk to.\n\nThis is absolutely not meant to be a pity party for me. The blame for my problems and my shitty life is mine, and mine alone. My father was a terrrible alcoholic too which is what killed him, but unlike him, I do recognize that the responsibility and the power to make any changes has to start with me. Although, I\u2019m slightly daunted by what a long road to recovery this is going to be, and I have a lot of self doubt whether or not I can make it. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine what a sober life might look like?\n\nSorry for the rambling post, but if anyone has been through similar in their past and has any advice for me, I\u2019d love to hear it.\n\nThx.", "2_timestamp": "2018-02-08 04:30:45", "3_author": "voluntold123", "comments": [{"AudiGuy3point0": [{"dubebl3": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-02-15 19:04:41", "1_text": "Wow, I relate to this so much it's scary.

I started new meds and was clean for about five months.  Then it crept back up and started showing up again.  My liver enzymes were almost normal so I celebrated with a drink.  And I keep celebrating.  And I hate it.\n\nMy meds helped immensely.  As did talk therapy.  Turns out I was using alcohol to mask my anxiety.  Once I hit it head on things got easier.  I could leave the house.  Became social again.  Found new hobbies and friends.  I'm still drinking but I don't hate myself the way I used to.

I really need some help regarding this. \n\nI\u2019m a 25 year old male with a pain-killer addiction, the addiction started around 4 years ago. The drug I am addicted to is Dihydrocodeine and also Codeine. These are of course opiate-based pain meds. I have never took anything else other than those two drugs. The amount I take per day varies on how many I can get hold of, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to take 20 30mg dihydrocodeine tablets a day if I could. \n\nI really, really want help. My life is falling apart, I\u2019ve lost my job, I don\u2019t blame the pills fully for it but they had a massive part to play. I know I\u2019d be a better and stronger person without this putrid addiction in my life. I would love nothing more than to wake up and not have to worry about getting my pills. \n\nI\u2019ve tried going cold turkey but needless to say this failed, the longest I lasted was 6 days and I have never felt so sick and defeated in my life. My main issue with getting help through the NHS is that I have a son who\u2019s a toddler, he stays with me a few nights a week (not with his Mum anymore) - I limit the amount of pills I take when he\u2019s in my care, I take enough to function but not so many that I\u2019m in another planet because my son means absolutely everything to me, he\u2019s the only positive I have in my life, the thought of never being able to see him is excruciating and it would end me. It would hurt him as well as I can tell he really loves and adores me. So I don\u2019t want to get help for them to take his details, alert social work/health visitors etc and for us to be separated because of this. Do you know what I mean?\n\nCan anyone shed any light as to how the process would work? I know what I need to do in terms of going to my doctor but will admitting to this pain killer addiction strike up some sort of red flag and will authorities intervene with me and my son? I know everyone must say it but I\u2019m really not a bad Dad, I\u2019ve provided for him since he was born, I have a savings account purely for him and his Mum, so I can continue to provide, I feed, wash, clothe him and most importantly give him all the love and attention in the world. But I don\u2019t want to be seen as an addict who is incapable of taking care of him, will this happen?\n\nSorry for the length of this message. I\u2019m really desperate for help. Thank you.

Honest discussion is the way to start building up a level of trust where you can support him if he chooses to stop, and to start that process will require brutal honesty on your part. Open yourself up completely, and show how it bothers you, and then it\u2019s his decision from there. If he decides to ignore what you say indefinitely, then it\u2019s your choice if you can live with the dissonance whenever his wishes aren\u2019t met by you. As much as we\u2019d sometimes like to, we can\u2019t control someone else, even if it\u2019s for their health.\n\nI\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t the only viewpoint on this topic, this is just mine. My dad is a daytime drinker, and it\u2019s such a part of him that I can\u2019t think of him without the drinking. As a teenager, I could never really tell him how I felt, because there wasn\u2019t a level of respect there for him to trust me. Now, as an adult, I have told him multiple times that I am against his drinking, as tactfully and politely as I can, and he reacts to it negatively each time, like a small child. If your father is still able to take outside advice, even if just partly, than I envy you, but my experience with addiction (and I\u2019ve dealt with it personally too) is that if the person does not want to fight for themselves, that\u2019s it. "}], "dtzpurx": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-02-09 10:47:59", "1_text": "There\u2019s a cliche which probably everyone has heard. \u201cIn order to love another, you first have to love yourself\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s used to explain the difficulties with relationships, but I believe it can be used in most situations regarding humans.\nWhen I was smoking weed daily, from morning to evening, I knew it had a negative effect on my life. It\u2019s hard to ignore it, to be honest. I had such low self esteem, however, that I would always turn to it. I\u2019m not stupid, and I could extrapolate from my non-addict friends that life could be better without it, but deep inside me I believed I was not capable of earning that life. With all the mistakes which I had saved and over analyzed in my mind, I knew I was broken, and even though I could logically see that it was possible to break the habit, that logic would only last until the next depressive phase. I did not love myself. I hated myself, to be completely clear, but it was a kind of subconscious hate, like I just felt that everything I did was not enough.\n\nBecause I couldn\u2019t care about myself, past the basic emotions like pleasure (or numbing pain), I couldn\u2019t really care about others. I had friends, but I didn\u2019t really care for them as much as I cared about my comfort. I would only put in effort to spend time with someone if it somehow benefited me. \nThis might sound like I\u2019m exaggerating, but it\u2019s a very subtle thing which I could only really explain after leaving the habit behind. I try to explain it to my stoner and alcoholic friends, but I know when I was in their position I would have just brushed it off as being overly dramatic.\n\nAnyway, as I see it there are 2 main ways which can motivate someone to fight the habit. The way my old boss recommends is for the people around the addict to show care and love, and gradually build up a level of trust, to the point where the addict can, in a sense, give the other person the responsibility of deciding for them. In this, the support group offers advice, and shows they will help in the struggle, giving the addict the strength to review their life and see that it has to change. This would be the way most clinics work, at least as a broad explanation. \n\nThe 2nd way is for the addict to reach such a low that they see very clearly the direction the addiction will take them. This was my path, as I didn\u2019t have much of a support group. The more I smoked, the higher my tolerance became, while at the same time the less control I had over my life. Both factors pushed me to smoke more to reach the same level of \u201ccomfort\u201d which I was used to. Eventually I couldn\u2019t reach that same level, and I was at a few points confronted by such discomfort that I knew, clear enough to burn the idea into my memory, that I had to change my life.\n\nI\u2019m kind of glad that I had such a fast downard spiral, because I was shocked out of it. My dad has been drinking red wine throughout the day every day since the last 40 years. Maybe 12 years back my mum took him to therapy, but he never reached that point. Now, he looks like a homeless drunk, and has been more or less disowned by the family.\n\nIt\u2019s sad, because after my own experiences I can understand a bit of his struggle. The problem is the person I have become can\u2019t love him enough to help him. I\u2019ve grown much in the last years, and I\u2019ve learned to care for others, but I know my dad and he won\u2019t change without a tremendous amount of effort from people around him. We would essentially be fighting him to fix his life, for years. It would take me years to be stable enough to help him, and I don\u2019t think he has that many years left.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if that went on a little long, but I had to think through my experiences step by step to explain what I want to explain. I hope you gained some understanding from my story. What I tried to explain is that there is no right way to deal with something like this. You are not obligated to carry his burdens. All you can do is live your life as you see right, and fight for who you want in your life. I wish I had a cool father-son relationship like some of my friends, but I\u2019m realistic enough to know that possibility is gone. Maybe for you it\u2019s still possible, that\u2019s for you to decide."}], "du034ti": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-02-09 14:17:15", "1_text": "You\u2019re very welcome mate."}]}]}]}], "t3_7wdbyh": [{"0_title": "Share/Rant/Discussion Fridays - February 09, 2018", "1_text": "Share your rants and thoughts here!

But frankly, I think you need something. It's just a question of how much risk you're willing to take, and the thing about meetings is that it outsources a bit of the responsibility of staying clean. People to disappoint if you relapse, people that you can tell you've relapsed who can give you third-person perspectives and advice. I actually think meeting-people are better than friends in this regard (even though they can obviously become friends), and I've always had an easier time being honest when it comes to the addiction struggle with strangers in the same boat as me than with friends and family. \n\nBut I understand you're gripe with meetings. What I would say is that there is just a very wide variety in meetings, even within the AA/NA framework, in any given city. Shopping around is important. I know for me there are some meetings that make me want to puke and provide me with nothing (but work well for others), while there are others that really work very well for me. Shopping around is important. The area the meeting takes place in, the time it's at, the type of meeting it is - all of these things can attract different types of people. And once the tone is set for a particular meeting, it tends to stick with that. There's so much of a variety that I actually get a little frustrated when I see people make generalizations about meetings, and then use that as an excuse not to go. I know I sound like a typical meeting evangelist, but that really is the truth of the matter. Unless you've really scoured your city for all the different types of meetings and different individual meetings, I don't think you can know that there won't be a meeting that works for you. And since the stakes are so high, I think it's totally worth it to suffer through some whiny meetings in trying to find the right one. \n\nI actually did a very intense, confrontational rehab program, and as a result I find people calling each other on their shit really important in recovery. And there's no doubt that there are a lot of meetings where it's *very* taboo to doubt people or to suggest that their complaints are negative thought pattern more than they are legitimate gripes with their situation. I totally agree - some meetings are just way too light, nothing but praise and encouragement. I don't like those at all, even though I know they work for people. Mostly because I can see people manipulating the group, sometimes outright lying, just trying to seek sympathy and affirmation. But I've found a meeting (it's actually connected to the rehab I went to) where confrontation isn't discouraged (or outright banned, like it seems to be in other meetings), and I'm grateful for it. Some meetings just seem so terrified of being \"judgmental\", that they let people get away with cycles of self-pity and constant appeals for affirmation, which I actually think is something addicts are incredibly prone to, and can easily lead to relapses or keep somebody from properly recovering. Some people seem to genuinely believe that the **only** thing that can ever lead to addiction is people being too hard on themselves, and that the most important antidote is just encouragement and affirmation. Everybody's situation is different, and it's obviously true a lot of the time, but I firmly disagree that this is a universal rule as many people seem to believe. Some people (including myself at various points) need to be told to wake up, grow up, stop feeling bad for themselves and make a real effort. And there's nothing worse for somebody who constantly wallows in self-pity than to have that pity affirmed by others, and to be told that they are doing everything they can and nothing is their fault.

I'm 3.5 weeks clean and hadn't really had any craving feelings yet but the past two days my anxiety is creeping up and I find my self with this craving a few times through out the day.\n\n\n..., so... what's a typical dose people tend to stick with? Also anyone that has had both zubsolv and suboxone, is one better then the other. \n\nAlso, it says to dissolve / melt under the tongue for 5 minutes. But this thing dissolves in like 10-15 seconds, 100% gone in about a minute. It ends up floating around my mouth in saliva after that. Is this wrong ? Am I not experiencing the full effects?", "2_timestamp": "2018-02-10 07:35:11", "3_author": "ExWebics", "comments": [{"stevenstevos": [{"du14aim": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-02-10 05:11:46", "1_text": "First off, cheers for making it 3.5 weeks--that is no small feat.  I had the same questions when I first started, and I have talked to dozens of others who have as well.  \n\nAs for what you should expect from taking Suboxone or Zubsolv, the medication essentially prevents you from having the withdrawal effects when you quit using opiates.  It takes away the \"physical\" dependence that comes with opiate addiction.  Basically it helps you feel normal and no longer addicted to opiates.\n\nRegarding Zubsolv dosage, one 5.6mg pill per day is pretty common.  Most people I have talked to were on a dosage of 1-2 pills per day.  In think Zubsolv works just as well as Suboxone.  Actually I think I preferred Zubsolv a little to Suboxone.\n\nAs for how long it takes for Zubsolv to dissolve, for me the pill does dissolve in a few minutes, but what is left is then liquid that takes 5-10 minutes before it is fully dissolved, which for me is when I can no longer taste it.  As long as you keep it under your tongue, it should work properly.\n\nAs far as your cravings, I am not sure...perhaps you may need a higher dosage, but I doubt it since you have been clean now for 3.5 weeks. If the cravings continue and/or get worse, you could talk to your doctor and ask if you can try a slightly higher dosage a few times.  Maybe try taking 1.25 pills per day and see if it helps with your cravings.  Zubsolv will not change how you feel about pills, so you may still have to work on your addiction from a mental/psychological perspective.  \n\nHopefully that helps..."}]}]}]}], "t3_7wjtcz": [{"0_title": "Any Recommendations On How to Quit Drinking All Together?", "1_text": "Hi Guys and Girls,\n\nI am a responsible financial professional in investment banking, former military, and college graduate.

You cannot have a relationship with someone like that.

It\u2019s just that it is almost impossible to well and truly save someone if they do not want to be saved. A full blown Addiction is horrible in that way. It takes all of the good things inside of you and turns then into black shit. I have lived that way and the only person who was going to be able to stop and revaluate how my life was going was me. I hope that you find a way to either get your parents to literally kick him out of the house or into rehab he will not have to face the reality of the life he is living. I would love nothing more than your brother to overcome his addiction and mend the family relationship.

My family all live overseas so it\u2019s generally not that difficult for me to keep my drug & alcohol useage a secret from them.\n\nSorry if I sound like a broken record to anyone who is a regular on here. But I endured a fairly frightening episode last week when I had to be admitted to hospital for drug related reasons. I won\u2019t bore you with the details but it left me a bit shaken, and I really felt it was the \u2018wake up call\u2019 I needed to change. I know I\u2019ve said this before, but after this incident I honestly believed I was ready to quit, so I threw out my last remaining drugs and that would be it.\n\nBy Friday I was starting to feel better and had a reasonably productive day at the office. But something happened on the way home, the only way I can describe it is like my addiction became self-aware and started calling the shots. Stupidly, I didn\u2019t dispose of my remaining blow very well and just left it in the thrash, that was a schoolboy error on my part for which there is no defence. I called in the liquor store and headed straight home as quick as I could. The blow hiding in the rubbish was burning a hole in my brain. As soon as I got there, I grabbed the rubbish and began picking through it by hand on my kitchen floor (I\u2019m still in my work suit at this point). After much searching, my heart lept with joy when I found that little bag of white gold under some old tea bags and half covered in the disgusting remains of an Indian takeaway.\n\nIt was pretty much game over at this point. I ended up doing all the blow and crushed the beers I\u2019d bought pretty quickly. In a rare moment of foresight, I\u2019d deleted my dealers number the day before. However as the drugs I had quickly ran out, I just ended up messaging a user-friendly of mine, and it turned out our dealer was going to be at a regular haunt of ours (this haunt is just a really shitty back alley pub that\u2019s essentially a drug market, more drugs get sold there than pints). This was good news because it means I didn\u2019t have to take a trip into the hood to get coke. I don\u2019t really remember the evening much after that point. I remember being extremely frustrated at how slow the cab to the pub was taking due to the punishing snowfall that was taking place. Other than that I remember waking up at 8am Saturday having slept for maybe 2-3hrs. I then spent all day yesterday drinking and doing drugs in what is a fairly typical day for me. I even managed to even make a joint out of some crumbs of weed I had collected from the bottom of a drawer.\n\nNeedless to say, I woke up this morning not really feeling too good about myself. I had a long dried red streak protruding from one of my nostrils. Every last crumb of blow is gone. Every last drop of booze is gone. I guess I got to just try and pick myself up and try again.

It's been a solid 20 years since I had any semblance of a reasonable relationship with him. Having him in my life, even if it was just tolerating being around him, has always been a struggle. He was never physically abusive, but was verbally abusive without even realising it (whis way of \"helping\" was to try and \"encourage\" you in a demeaning manner). This was exacerbated with drinking (wouldn't consider him an alcoholic).\n\n\nI'm not quite sure how to phrase it, so i'll use the typical \"I struggle to hold a steady job\". It goes beyond that, however. I struggle to land a job. This will be touched on later, but I got a late start on the job search because of school. I've held what's considered a \"part time\" job for near a decade now (2009), working at a local university medical center as what's called a standardized patient. The long story short is i'm an actor portraying a (usually) scripted role and assessing the bedside manners and clinical skills of medical students (ranging from premed to residency). It's a job I love as i've always been completely fascinated with medicine, but it's nowhere even close to being a sustainable job. I may work every day one week, and then it may be two, three, or four months until i'm needed again. more on this in the next section, however. Outside of that, i've held essentially one full-time job during 2013. I began working in the warehouse of the company that my sister works for (she's a graphic designer) I held this job until I was literally physically incapable of doing so. I experienced an on-the-job injury that I never reported (I was a temp, they would have let me go, and had I fought it, it would have caused hell for my sister) that was entirely related to violation of OSHA standards. I worked through physical pain for roughly six months that genuinely made me want to collapse in a ball and cry, it's now a permanent physically limiting injury. After visiting numerous specialists, physical therapists, and musculoskeletal rehab, it's been deemed that surgery is the only option that remains; this surgery fails just as often as is succeeds, and if it fails, it's *very* likely to make the situation worse. Those are odds I can't risk. i'm at a point where having to exert or lift weight above around 30 lbs is a struggle. My left arm will often just give out under weakness. I feel this limits my job search, but everyone around me continually tells me to lie on applications and \"explain why\" should something happen should something happen at work, I refuse to do so (i'm not keen on putting myself through that kind of physical pain again, nor am I keen on lying on my application as it's grounds for immediate termination; i don't need a termination on my record, it's hard enough as it is).\nAt this point in my life, i'm applying for literally everything that I can come up with. I'd estimate that i've put forth a thousand applications in the last year. (surely I must be kidding, right? No.), and i've gotten a handful at best of callbacks, none of which lead anywhere.\n\n* **tl;dr: I struggle to hold a job and I have a physically limiting injury that limits my job search**\n\nMore on school and why I love my job. Ever since I was little, i've been fascinated by medicine. I was the kid that was reading books on anatomical structures during reading time, or medical journals when we had free use of computers at school. In particular, i've always had a love for veterinary science. Ever since I can remember, i've wanted to be a vet, it seems like a natural fit; I love medicine, and I love animals. This is why I love my job as an SP, i'm still involved in medicine; I know the intricate details beyond how you (the student) arrive at your differential diagnoses of every case i've ever portrayed. I go home, I research them, and i'm fascinated by it. The team that I work under (some MD, some PHD, RN, LVN, PA, and some with \"only\" an MSEd, basically the instructors) love me because of my dedication, and use me whenever they can. At this point, I think every single one of them have tried to help me land a permanent position at the institution. I say this not to boast about myself, but to say that I realize that my life isn't all dead flowers and rotten tomatoes.\nAs I said previously, I got a late start on the working portion of my adult life. I can attribute this to school. I can confidently say that I stopped learning in a school setting in about the fourth grade. Most everything I know is because it's either intrinsic to me, or i've sought out the information on my own terms. I slogged through to my high school days, confidently saying it was a waste of my time. I \"dropped out\" of traditional high school and enrolled in a type of homeschooling called independent study. I met with a teacher once a week, but other than that, I was free to teach myself. I learned FAR more efficiently this way than had I stuck to traditional 8-3pm school schedule. I graduated, and pushed myself to to college. It was a 2.0 of primary education. a waste of my time. I'm no learning anything, and i'm struggling to focus on the matters that are unimportant to me. I have ultimately dropped out of college three times now. had I pursued a degree and focused on a discipline, I have enough credits under my belt to technically qualify to petition for graduation with a Masters, but I don't even have so much as an associates to show for it.\nBy no means to I consider myself a stupid person. In fact, my reading level is in the top 1% in the nation, my reading comprehension is in the top 2% (broad reading ability is in the top 1.5%), my writing skills are in the top 2%, my verbal and written vocabulary are in the top 4%, ETC. I know these numbers as I put myself through multiple different learning disability evaluations, and the results were repeatable. Where I struggle most with is in math on the broad spectrum, my math skills are \"normal\" for where I should be, I score within the top 51%. There is an abnormally large deficit between all my other academic skills and my math that I do qualify for a form of learning disability assistance, and it's going to sound like i'm boasting here, but it's referred to as Gifted disabled. What this essentially boils down to is that my brain does not understand why I don't do as well in math as I do in all other aspects of a \"well rounded student\", essentially it implodes on itself when I have to try and assess math. This has held me back in a school setting as my math grades slip drastically if I don't dedicate nearly all of my time to math,  but when I do so, all my other grades slip because of my lack of motivation and interest in learning in a school setting.\n\n* **tl;dr: I love medicine, I would love to be a vet some day, but don't see it being attainable because of the math involved and the education taking place in a school setting. I struggle with school, particularly math, but repeatedly place phenomenally well in all other aspects.**\n\nWhen it comes to technology, it's always been a hobby of mine. I built my first computer when I was 12, and I taught myself the basics of Java, HTML, and C+ over time. I've taken classes for a degree in I.T., Computer Information Technologies, and Computer Information Systems (tiree different degrees from three different schools I attended, but did not complete) I'm MCITP and Cisco certified, but I know, without a doubt, that it's not a job that I want to do. I can't sit behind a desk and work day in and day out at a desk job for the rest of my life, I would genuinely hate my life. But, it's something that I do well.\n\nAnother lifelong dream of mine has been to follow in my grandfather's footsteps. He enlisted in the USMC to do his part in the second world war. He's someone that i've looked to as a father figure for most of my life (see above for my relationship with my dad). On my 18'th birthday, I contacted a recruiter, set up a meeting, and met with him. The meeting took all of about six minutes wherein I found out I was disqualified from enlisting as my path through high school was nontraditional. Independent study disqualified me from service. Upon seeking help for depression, I sealed the casket with a nail, some super glue, around the seems, put the casket inside a steel box, welded that box shut, then shot that box into deep space on a rocket designed to detonate with a kiloton nuclear warhead on an unknown trajectory.\n\nI'm an avid supporter of the second amendment. I've been around firearms all my life, and i'm an amateur gunsmith. Becoming an accredited gunsmith would be an in-and-out process for me, but unfortunately, there's very little room for growth or opportunity in gunsmithing. Every professional gunsmith i've ever talked to have said that because there's little room for growth, gunsmithing is a side job, a hobby, as they couldn't support themselves on what they earn. Keep in mind here that gunsmithing and engineering are two very different things with very similar outer appearances.\n\n* **tl;dr: the things I do well, i'd hate to do as a job, i've been disqualified from, or don't provide a sustainable future.**\n\nThese are the persistent environmental factors that play into my depression. Obviously there have been other nonpersistent factors.\n\nNow, here comes the short part:\n\nI sought help for depression in 2012. I was diagnosed with severe recurrent depression and tried a number of antidepressants until settling on Paxil. I started on a 10MG dose, upped to 20, then 40, and finally settled on 50. it helped a little with management of my day to day life, but something never felt quite right.\nIn late 2015/early 2016, I was unknowingly removed from my medical insurance plan. My father was the primary on the account, and the notification was sent to him that I was removed. He either didn't receive it, removed me without telling me, or didn't care enough to contact me about the issue; I don't rightly care any way you look at it. \n\nWhen I went to make an appointment to refill my paxil, I was notified that I was no longer covered, and as a result, wasn't actually able to see my psychiatrist. I had a week prescription of paxil left that I stretched out to two weeks (half doses) it took nearly a month to resolve the issue and find coverage again. For two weeks I experienced withdrawals, and if you asked me during them, I would have thought I was dying. Cold sweats, twitching, irritability, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision, the whole nine yards, along with what the worst part of it, a phenomenon I still can't explain to people. It feels like electrical shots running through my brain, particularly when my eyes change focus or focal planes. It's almost as though I can feel my brain focusing, and hear a static noise in my inner ear as my eyes move.\n\nIn the time that my paxil ran out, and my withdrawals started, however, I realized that I felt better in nearly every single way than when I was on paxil. I had motivation to do things, I felt better just in general, and people noticed that I was just a different person as a whole.\n\nSince being covered under insurance, i've since decided that I wanted to stop taking paxil. I talked to my psychiatrist about it, and he was very unsupportive in the decision, strongly encouraging me to remain on paxil. so, i've take it upon myself to wean myself off of it. It's been a process that's been ongoing for roughly five months, far longer than any literature on the subject outlined. I've been reducing by half doses. The pills are 20mg, i'm on 50mg, meaning two and a half tablets every day. I don't know the exact time frame by day when I reduced doses, but it's gone form 50 (2-1/2), 40 (2), 30 (1-1/2), 20 (1) 10(1/2) daily, I then switched to 10mg every other day, then once every three days. I've been on once every three days for about three weeks, and completely stopped taking them about a week ago. while down to once every other day and once/3 days, I began to notice all the withdrawal symptoms coming back, but they were mild. I was by no means feeling fantastic, but I could manage day-to-day. Since completely stopping, the withdrawal symptoms have come back en force, it feels identical to when I went cold turkey.\n\nIt's obvious that my body as developed a dependency on paxil, but i'm determined to break myself of it. I want to feel better, I want to be in a better place, I want to be in the place where paxil should help me get, but is so very apparently holding me back from. Starting paxil absolutely destroyed my metabolism as well, Prior to starting it, I was on roughly a 4k calorie diet just to maintain my weight, I was active. Since going on it, i've cut that down to less than half and i'm still gaining weight. I've gone from 181 to about 220 at my current weight. those numbers include muscle mass loss and fat gain. My activity has dropped; I don't work out anymore, I don't run, I don't exercise in general because i've lost the desire to do so.\n\nSo my questions come in here:\n\n1. For withdrawals, how do you manage them? what are some coping mechanisms that you believe may help? I\"m not expecting a one-stop fix, but as i'm sitting here typing this, i'm having those \"electrical\" feelings in my brain. Yesterday, I had a fight with my mother (I don't even remember what about, something stupid), and after, for several hours, my irritability wanted me to punch a hole through the wall. I don't want people to talk to me. I don't even want them to look at me because I know it's going to irritate me. I've got the chills, full-on shivering chills, but i'm sweating. I'm struggling to focus both literally, and figuratively. My eyes are struggling to focus on one point, and i'm struggling to keep focused on the things I need to do. I'm sick to my stomach, can't keep foods down, and have absolutely zero appetite. My head is pounding, and my arms and legs are a twitching mess. I'm basically a nonfunctioning existence right now, but I have obligations that I have to meet.\n\n2. If anyone has experienced withdrawals from SSRIs, how long did it take for you to get over them? Everything i've read has said it's anywhere from a couple days to several months, but that things should slowly and progressively improve. None of these were accounts of people who went through them personally. In the two weeks previously where I was forced to go cold turkey, my symptoms didn't seem to improve in the slightest. If this is going to be a months-on-end type deal, even after a slow degression  i'm not entirely sure how i'm going to function in the slightest.\n\nI apologize for the wall of text, but I had to put something out there, I couldn't  keep to myself, and sometimes the anonymity of the internet can actually be a positive thing. I can release myself to people i'll likely never meet and seek help from them in ways i've not been able to find.\n\nThis will be cross-posted on both /r/addiction and /r/depression.", "2_timestamp": "2018-02-12 01:33:37", "3_author": "SSGTSemperFi", "comments": [{"Pm_MeyourManBoobs": [{"dues25b": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-02-17 17:29:11", "1_text": "Fantastic post!

I write this more for my own sake then for anything else. That being said, this is going to be really long and detailed so read it, don't read it, read only parts of it, I don't really care.\n\nTo this day, I don't believe weed is that bad of a drug but I do now believe it can become an addiction and I know that it can change your life for the worst.\n\nWhen I was in high school, I did not smoke weed except on very rare occasions. Even when I did, I was such a novice that I didn't really understand the concept of inhalation and often just sucked it in, and blew it straight out. Because of this, I believed back then that weed had no real effect. I thought what people talked about when they talked about getting high was just hyperbole's, I believed they were just exaggerating to make themselves sound cooler. I graduated from my High School as the valedictorian, just barely beating my best friend by a fraction of a grade point. Back then I was quite naive about alot of things. My only real experiences with drugs was with alcohol, but even then, it was mostly sleeping over my best friends, hiding in his room and splitting a bottle of vodka or a 12 pack of Mike's Hard after his parents fell asleep. I had never been to a real party, had never really kissed a girl let alone do anything remotely sexual and had never gotten high. I wasn't an unpopular kid though, and had a variety of friends, some of which would be labeled stoners or deadbeats or just generally \"bad kids.\" They would tell me stories about how they got wasted and did this thing or that with this person or that person. I could imagine what they were talking about but just had no personal experiences of my own to relate.\n\nThe summer after I graduated High School, my older sister was dating a man who we now know was a major marijuana dealer. One night when my parents weren't home, he came over and offered me and my best friend a bowl. We went outside to smoke it, not expecting much, but it must have been some really good bud because even though we both didn't know how to inhale properly, we got majorly stoned. We ended up watching Dude, Where's My Car? right after finishing and just died laughing every 10 seconds. It was fun. I can remember after that, I asked my sister to buy me a bowl, and she did. Before I could even use it one time, it was found by my mother who freaked out. By this time, I was already accepted to a prestigious university with a sizable scholarship so clearly she was worried about my future. I told her it wasn't mine, I was just holding it for a friend, whether or not she believed, she dropped the matter anyway. \n\nWhen the summer ended, I was off to be a freshman at a college far away from my small hometown, far away from my close group of friends from high school. I can remember being just scared to death, particularly because I had planned to just stick with my roommate to get through my first year but ended up being given a single dorm room, so I'd be all by myself. Anyway, weeks passed at college and I wasn't quite making friends as quick as I thought I would. Then I remember a guy, who I'm still good friends with today, coming to my door and asking me if I wanted to smoke some weed with him in his car. He had been attempting to find some smoking buddies but had been turned down more than he expected, so even though we were just acquaintances, he asked me. Since I had actually been high once before and I wanted to make more friends, I went with him. So we get in his new Mercedes, he turns on his very nice sound system with Dubstep and House music and settle in. I had never hotboxed before, and really had never smoked correctly, but that all changed after that night. Looking back, my experience there, just so god damn stoned, chilling in a nice car listening to weird but amazingly intense music with a new friend was the beginning of my change. I can remember that after we finished smoking and chilling, I went back to my room and just reveled in the feeling. I went on my computer and started downloading the music we listened to. Being high has always made my mind race and that night I was having incredibly vivid daydreams while re-listening to the music. It was fun. \n\nSoon, me and my new friend were heading out to his car on a semi-regular basis, even recruiting another guy who lived on our floor to come with us, and all 3 of us would create the hotbox, chill, listen to good music, and just daydream. I was starting to really, really like weed, not only for the effects it had on me but because it had become an effective avenue towards making new, lasting friendships. \n\nI am not, nor have I ever been, wealthy but I soon discovered that both my new friends came from very well off families who would often send them money just because. I have been working since the day I turned 14 and although I didn't just save it all, I did have a sizable sum of my own money that I really had no use for. Well I soon found a use for it. As you can't just keep bumming weed off other people, I was soon finding myself looking for dealers, even going so far as DMing my sisters now ex-boyfriend to ask if he could send me weed. Needless to say, dealers starting appearing out of, what seemed like, thin air and I was no longer in need of supply. At first, I didn't really care (or have knowledge of) how much I got, at what price, or what the quality of the bud was. But as time passed and smoking became a much more frequent habit of mine, I learned the ropes so to speak. I learned about eights, quarters, halves, and ounces, I learned roughly how much they should cost but above all, learned about quality. At college, good bud was hard to come by and most of the time what we smoked was bushweed. At first, it didn't matter because everything got me blitzed, but I started to find that I had to smoke a lot more of the crap weed to even catch a buzz and my money was flying out of my bank account fast as I would sometimes need to buy multiple times in a single day. Combine that with alcohol costs, as the world of drunken college parties opened up to me, and I was out of money pretty quickly. I never regretted any of it though because I felt like I was walking into a bigger, more chaotic and mature world and it was fun. \n\nAll the while, my grades weren't bad by any means but I certainly did not find myself as dedicated to my school work as much as I was in high school. Since the classes were mostly all intro classes and I was naturally pretty smart, I kind of just coasted through them all, getting 3.0's in basically everything. This would eventually change drastically. \n\nThat summer was odd, it seemed like my old high school friends just wanted to talk about the new friends they had made at school and their freshman experiences. I didn't realize at the time that I wasn't any different than they were, but I started to feel disconnected from them. I turned towards weed to help me cope with this. I started hanging out more and more with the \"bad kids\" from my high school class, the ones who would tell me stories about partying, ones who didn't go away to college and were basically still doing the same things they were doing in high school. But mostly, I worked. Except now I found that I had a \"bill\" as it were, that I previously didn't have, namely the weed bill and I just didn't seem to ever make as much as I used to because a part of it consistently slipped away. \n\nMy sophomore year of college started with me being placed into a triple with two juniors I didn't know, while my two college weed smoking buddies got into a triple together with another kid who very rarely would come smoke with us. It felt like I'd been left out, and I wasn't particularly excited about going back. As it turns out, the guys in my triple were amazing people and they introduced me to a whole new group of close-knit friends and I quickly went from being \"the new guy\" to just being me. As it also turns out, almost everyone in my new group of friends smoked weed and liked to party, so I introduced my old weed smoking buddies to them all and soon we all were like a family. My triple became this common room to us all, and our friends would come and go as they pleased. We would smoke in there, chill in there, have parties in there, bring hook-ups in there, just the most stereotypical college stuff. And besides the fact that we got in trouble with security quite a few times and the Dean of Discipline now knew me personally, and not in a good way, it was the best time of my life. For about a semester and a half, my life was like a dream, with great friends, great times, and every day being a new adventure. And although my grades were slowly slipping below the 3.0 mark and I was pretty damn broke, I just didn't care because I was having so much fun. \n\nThen the bubble burst when we discovered some shocking secrets about one of the members of our core group; one of my roommates in the triple. We all already knew he used to be a major pot dealer during his sophomore year, passing off pounds at a time, but what we didn't know was that he actually got busted by the DEA and was working with them to help bust some other major dealers on campus. This guy was like my brother, during the short time we knew each other we had had some deep conversations about life growing up in Ireland, his past, his previous drug issues with heroin, all kinds of shit. And then one day he changes like someone hit a switch, he doesn't want to do anything but drink, all day, everyday. He doesn't go to class, he just sits in our room and drinks. One day we come back to find him crying his eyes out over a bottle of whiskey, he tells us his brother in Ireland just recently died in a terrible car crash. We try to cheer him up as much as possible but all he wants to do is drink. Soon security is pounding on our door daily looking for him, while he hides in our armoire until they leave. They say he isn't allowed on this campus anymore and if we harbor him we could face serious consequences. Eventually, we convince him to leave, we help him pack everything up, we give him a ride to a friends place in the nearby village and we say goodbye to him forever. But when we start talking more to his recently ex-girlfriend about the whole situation, the truth about the DEA comes out and so much more. It turns out his \"brother\" who he showed us pictures of and told us stories about isn't his brother, its just a good friend of his from his hometown, he isn't dead, and neither of them are from Ireland. Turns out the day we found him crying was the day he received notice that he wasn't allowed on campus anymore. Needless to say, we were all stunned.\n\nThe group kind of split in half after that, and I found myself spending more and more time just smoking weed with my friends from freshman year and less time partying & drinking and instead just smoking, all the time. I found myself stealing money and weed from my friends but was always very careful that they didn't know it was me. Meanwhile, I was going to classes very infrequently and just barely passed that year. I had changed. \n\nThat summer, I got a new, better paying job, but still made no more money since I was smoking quite a bit daily. I almost never talked to my old high school friends nor the other high school kids I would hang out with last summer. The only real social interactions I had were with my co-workers and I spent a lot of my private time getting high and playing video games. As the final months of summer were ending, I grew very close to a foreign girl who worked where I worked until the fall started and as I got closer and closer to her, I began to panic at the thought of having to leave her and go back to school while she soon after leaves America forever. So when I finally get back to school, I spend most of my time just smoking, sitting around, doing nothing. I was placed into a double far away from the friends I had kept after the schism of our group and therefore had little social interaction. To make matters worse, my roommate just never showed up at school so I had what was know as a \"Dingle.\" Basically a double room size all to myself. Most students love when this happens, but for me, it only increased my isolation. I found myself taking long car drives back home almost every weekend to see this girl. Needless to say, my schoolwork, personal funds, or personal health were pretty low on my priorities list and when she finally left for good, I basically became a hermit. I'd just sit in my room, going outside every hour or so to smoke a bowl, and then go back in my room to do nothing. I found myself taking long naps and essentially stumbled upon lucid dreaming. In my dreams, I could be with her or with my old sophomore friends or anywhere that made me happy and weed was the tool that knocked me out. Being awake started to feel terrible, and I wouldn't leave my room for anything but food or weed and definitely not class. Things started to get so bad that I had to take an official withdrawal from school or risk officially failing all my classes and having it be on my transcript. \n\nThe bulk of the summer passed as the last one did, smoking weed day in and day out, doing nothing but work and when it came time to head back to school, I simply was not ready. I had made absolutely no progress in regards to my mental state and knew that going back to school would just result in another year of being a hermit. So I stayed home, continued to work, and enrolled in some bullshit classes at a nearby community college to appease my mother.\n\nYet, life works in weird ways, and I soon found myself, now approaching my mid-twenties, in a relationship with another co-worker of mine, this time a local 17-year old high school senior. Looking back, I most certainly was just looking for a tiny bit of happiness in my dreary life and never expected the relationship to become anything more than physical but as the weeks turned into months, our relationship started to become something so much deeper. We were truly falling for each other. However, naturally, as our relationship started to grow, her parents grew more and more concerned, for her future seemed even brighter than mine did when I was leaving high school. She was a world-class musician, her mother being a music teacher at a very prestigious prep school and her father being an accomplished pianist, she had been training since she was very little and by the time I knew her, she was looking at some very hard-to-get-into music schools. She confessed that they liked me well enough, but did not for a second like the fact that I was taking up so much of her time, time they wanted her to be spending practicing. Meanwhile, she and her parents knew of my marijuana smoking, they knew of my withdrawal from a good school and my recent enrollment in a not-so-good community college. It got to a point where they were basically telling her to leave me. Even with the pressure from home, we tried to make it work but just like at school, I wasn't regularly attending classes, wasn't doing homework, and above all, smoking, smoking, smoking all the time. It got to a point where I had to lie to her about how my classes were going and I had to lie about how much weed I smoked. \n\nFor the second semester, I decided to try and head back to college and try to change. I wanted to put more effort into my classes and work on reversing my decline in personal health (was getting pretty chubby.) And at the start, things looked very promising. We agreed to stay together and try a long-distance relationship and I was also able to get into a suite with my freshman friends. I was only back at school for about a week or two when she called me and told me our relationship was over. She told me over tears that she still deeply cared for me but that our time as a couple was over and I knew she had finally succumbed to the family pressure. It was devastating. I immediately fell into old habits, smoking all day and night, doing no schoolwork, and just being generally numb all the time. Meanwhile, I was back to stealing weed from my friends except now they started to have suspicions about me and our bonds started to loosen. Then one day, as I was trying to open a can of pineapples with a knife it slipped and I cut open my entire right index finger. Immediately, it started to bleed very badly and as I went into my room to try to bandage it up, I passed out. I woke up on the floor of my room, I don't know how much later, with a great pain and tenderness on the back of my head. I felt it to find it was also bleeding and looked back to find blood on the door of my roommates armoire. Since all my suite mates were at class, I immediately started to walk to the campus health center by myself. Halfway there, I entirely forgot what I was doing and walked straight back to my suite. Thankfully, one of my suite mates had returned from class, and upon seeing my poor state, escorted me to the health center where they determined that I had a concussion. They bandaged me up and sent me back to my suite, where I made no change in my behavior. I smoked daily even though it gave me terrible headaches and overall did nothing. Eventually, I was told by the campus nurse that I should take a medical withdrawal and that she would personally sign off on it. So once again, I found myself withdrawing from school, however this time it would be my last. \n\nThat was about 5 or 6 years ago and I can honestly say that my life has changed only very slightly since I arrived home. I still work at the same summer job, I have not gone back to school, I still live at home, but above all, I still smoke weed daily. It feels like time is just frozen for me and nothing changes.\n\nThe only blessing in my life is my beautiful niece who has become my reason for living. I am her favorite person and she always tells her mother (my sister) that she wants to come over our house so we can play. And through her, I have found what life was once like without weed, since I NEVER smoke before she comes over. When I'm with her, I feel awake again and as soon as she leaves, all I can think about is smoking. I stay up until 3 or 4 AM every night, smoking bowl after bowl and sleep and dream until noon almost every day. And since my job is seasonal I don't even leave the house. I have become a pot smoking hermit who literally does nothing all day. I don't have any friends who live around me because they have all moved onto bigger and better places. I went from the brightest student in my high school class to a deadbeat and weed has made me numb to the whole thing. \n\nBut I can't do this anymore, I can't spend another year doing absolutely nothing. I can't watch all the money I earn go right into my bowl. I can't see everyone I know getting real jobs, getting married, and having kids while I haven't done anything for more than half a decade. I fear a day will come when my niece will understand that her favorite person in the world is a bum, who is doing nothing with his life. I fear a day will come when my very unhealthy state will kill me just out of the blue. I already hack up shit loads of mucus daily and at times have thin, wheezy breath. My muscles ache from coughing so much and I feel 30 years older than my actual age. And when I think about how I can stop the cycle, how I can work on moving onward in my life, I always come back to the same answer: stop smoking weed. It has become my life, it is what I look forward to when I wake up and what I do before I go to bed. When I run out, I can feel my mind start to panic, I think about what I can do to get more, I think about how much money I have left and when I will be able to get more money so I can get more weed. I find myself smoking and just sitting on the couch going through options of what to do to pass the time, each one more boring the next, until hours have passed with me just doing absolutely nothing. It just isn't fun anymore. \n\nSo now is the time. Now is the time in which I will finally quit. I want control of my life again, I want to get excited about what will happen tomorrow instead of just feeling numb about another day coming and going. I want to be healthy again and not feel like I'm just slowly dying without doing anything. But above all, I want to get that feeling of meeting new people, going to new places, having new experiences again. I want to feel excited about the future for the first time in a very long time. \n\nThankfully, just writing this down and admitting it all to myself is giving me that feeling. I'm feeling hope that things can get better, and the very first and most important thing that I need to do is stop smoking weed. And although it fills me with fear and anxiety thinking about not having weed, I know it is what must be done. \n\nIf you made it this far, then I thank you for taking, what was most likely, a large amount of time out of your day to read my story. And if it helped you in any way then I am glad. We are the masters of our own destiny and when you wish to see a change in your life, the only way it can happen is if you make it happen.

Addiction is a loaded term, which has social and contextual origins that have more to do with religious fervor, racism, and the criminalizing marginal groups in society in the first two decades of the twentieth century. In fact, its use in the United States corresponds to government efforts to prohibit substances and turn the \u201cfiend\u201d \u201cjunkie\u201d \u201caddict\u201d \u201cslave to drugs\u201d into an enemy that should be eradicated. You get a pretty good trend line starting in 1914 around the time of the Harrison Act and then see a dramatic incline which aligns with the government gaining the legal authority to prosecute drug cases. Substance use disorder moves away from all this problematic lexical association but continue to hold in major publications although I believe the Associated Press recently changed its editorial standards to meet the updated standards. In the next few decades I expect addiction will only exist in colloquial form.

A habit can be broken over time, 3 1/2 years of being clean and the desire to use still exists for me, and it will exist for the rest of my life.

I\u2019ll report back in about a month!\n\nI\u2019m almost 25 years old, flunked out of college after thousands of dollars wasted over the course of three years. Never been able to hold a job. Lost my rent house because of that and now I\u2019m in debt by thousands of dollars. \n\nThe longest I\u2019ve gone without getting drunk for the last 8 years is probably about a week. Now I\u2019m getting drunk almost every night. And from there leads to my nastiest habit. Cocaine. Almost always in large amounts, which leads to me constantly owing money to people.\nI have a bad adderall/vyvanse habit also (used to be really bad, lost 40 lbs in one semester) which eventually led to me trying meth multiple times. I\u2019ve been abusing MDMA sporadically for the past two years, sometimes almost every week for a month. With all this stimulant use comes the crash. I\u2019ve never been one for opiates, but benzodiazepines are what I use for dealing with the comedowns.. it\u2019s been a never ending cycle replacing one drug with another.\n\nI make an ass of myself all the time, always get told I\u2019m annoying, have NEVER been able to date someone for longer than a few months. (They almost always back out as soon as they get to know who I really am)\n\nI live back at home with my parents and I\u2019m ashamed of it. I lie to them all the time now, I make promises I never keep and it\u2019s tearing me up. I get told to grow the fuck up all the time. I just lost my job last week and have done nothing but get absolutely messed up for the past 9 days. Not to mention almost every paycheck went to my bar tab and drugs.

I advise anyone that can go into treatment to do so, because early recovery is exceptionally difficult. It's a lot easier if you have some professional guidance. However, it's difficult to find decent treatment providers. I have both been a patient/client of treatment facilities and currently work for a treatment facility. These are my suggestions.\nOne don't use an insurance company to find a treatment facility. Insurance companies look for the cheapest treatment options generally speaking and there are other issues related to insurance companies and the way they deal with people that need addiction treatment.\nIf you're doing benzos and alcohol regularly you'll also need  to detox from them, because the sudden withdrawal from those substances causes seizures, and you can die from those seizures.  My suggestion is to look into long term treatment options first. Call those facilities up and speak to them about their services and request tours. Visit the facilities and try to get a feel for them. Also, get your family involved, let them know where you're at. I know that's hard, but they'll likely be your biggest asset and resource in getting help. Here's a guide I wrote for parents this may help them: https://sobanewjersey.com/guide-families-addicts-alcoholics/ \nAgain, try to get as much help and guidance as possible. You probably should start checking out the 12-step meetings in your area as well. Because of the substances you're on you'll definitely need at the very least detox. If you don't go into long term treatment, or make plans for treatment after treatment, at the very least look into the vivitrol  shot, it reduces alcohol cravings, and is exceptionally helpful for the first few months of recovery."}]}], "throwaway1901110110": [{"du70wmr": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-02-13 13:25:29", "1_text": "I just spoke with a rehab facility in Florida.

The longest I've had clean was nine months, about a year into my addiction. Destroyed my college career in architectural Engineering and shattered my family and social life.\nThe most recent clean time I had was 8 months, 2 years ago, but  5 months of that was spent in county jail, for possession violation charge.\nBeen to jail 3 times, split between three different jails.\nAll were for possession.\nWas arrested twice at the same spot.\nGuess where I went to cop my last bender?\nSame fucking spot.\nEven on the way home I told myself that I'm a fucking idiot.\nAnd that's what I feel like, a fucking idiot.\nBy God's grace I haven't lived on the street or haven't caused any serious health problems that I know of due to addiction.\nI want to stop. I've been wanting to stop for the last 8 years. \nUsually I binge on the weekends because my money is gone during the week. The past few months have seen at least $700 to 900 dollars pass thru my hands to drug dealers. In one fucking day!\nI've tried NA, I can't open up.\nI went to meeting last year every week and still was fucking using. Not court mandated, on my own will, even had to take 2 trains to get there. I don't think I ever said a word in that room.\nMy war stories are the same as everyone elses, so no need to dive into them.\nMy situation is I am an addict and I want to stop.\nI have a great job as a cook, a wonderful loving girlfriend who is a drug counselor ( she know my history, doesn't know that I use every weekend, and the two times that I've been caught up in my lies they were \"relapses\"), and a roof over my head.\nReading some of these posts gave me enough confidence to share my addiction.\nI want some tips on how to stay clean. I've tried the exercise, I'm an avid runner when not completely blown out of my mind. It just doesn't work. Nothing seems to work. I'll go through the week or sometimes two if rent is due absolutely no fine. No cravings no thoughts. I work hard, I stay busy.

I've tried handed my finances off to my girlfriend, and she was willing to help, but she was also resistant because she said it's not really helping because what's going to happen when Im forced to handle my money again. \nI think a huge part of the problem is that I love alone and there is no one to hold me accountable for anything. I've lived with others before but the drugs always find a way.\nRuined a lot of great relationships, but I think i found my wife this time.\nWe're moving in together in a month and I am very excited to be with her and I'm elated that someone will be there to hold me accountable.\nBut I know that addiction always finds a way, so I'm petrified of ruining this.\nI need help.\nI've thought about rehab but I've also worked in a mental hospital/county crisis center/ detox rehabilitation center for five years. I used the whole time, shit I was smoking blunts on my break. I was a psychiatric tech, preaching to addicts while high. \nSo I know what rehab entails, and I know that most of time it doesn't work unless you are fully committed to staying clean.\nI don't know if there is something wrong with me or if I just like getting high.\nReading some posts last night made we ponder about seeing a psychologist, maybe they'll have some insight for me.\nBut in the meantime I need help. I have a little less then 24 hours clean and I want this time to last \nAny tips on how you guys were able to break the 30 day plain would be appreciated, also any motivation would help too.\nI just want to use my full potential in life.

That might be hard if you have your spots you know, but you could find a way to cut those people from your life. \n\nAnother thing is start to meditate during the week if you can, or yoga. Something that slows your thought process so you have time to think. That way, when a craving hits on the weekend, you are able to practice more self-control/pause before succumbing to it. This is super important. if you don\u2019t like yoga or meditation just find something that slow you or makes you introspective (example: practice reading short stuff/books and question yourself after each paragraph - \u2018What did I just read?\u2019 Or each sentence \u2018okay, what does this mean?\u2019 This might seem stupid but it trains your mind to reflect before acting.\n\nWrite down the 3 most important reasons you want to quit and put them in your pocket everyday, look at them throughout the day.

Don\u2019t shame yourself, addiction is hard. Another poster mentioned something similar about building a better life, and I agree. I think social contact is important for any human so if you could by any way find somewhere to volunteer or do something, that\u2019d be great. You don\u2019t have to talk at first if you don\u2019t want to, just SHOW up. Would be helpful if you made this commitment on Fridays and Saturdays to replace the craving from coke.

The only difference is my case load is much smaller and I\u2019m supervised more closely. \n\nI\u2019m 22. I had a client who is 21 and completed 30 days of inpatient rehab for his Heroin addiction. The facility had recommended that he goes to a halfway house for an additional 90 days. The client refused any aftercare. His parents didn\u2019t know what to do with him so they drove him to the office and I got a call when I was opening my lunch saying you have someone here to see you. They dropped him off to talk to me. He was adamant he wasn\u2019t going and he didn\u2019t need anymore help. \n\nLittle did his parents know, I was a grieving girlfriend of a similar situation. I can say I\u2019ve moved on but I still have a heavy heart when it comes to this subject. \n\nI asked my client to tell me what\u2019s going on. I let him talk about why he didn\u2019t want to go to aftercare. I wanted to hear what his plans were for himself. I eventually got him to admit he\u2019s afraid of relapsing. I made him elaborate what he thinks could happen if he relapses. I just listened. I let him talk for a good 20-30 minutes. He didn\u2019t have any plan other than live with his parents and hope they run a tight ship. He told me death is a possibility. \n\nI hit him hard and heavy with I just experienced your future if you keep going down the road you\u2019re on. I told him what that phone call was like with my boyfriends mom telling me he\u2019s gone. I told him what his families faces looked like when I saw them. I told him what it was like to hear them screaming when they found out his cause of death. I tried to make him picture my boyfriends mom finding him dead on the bathroom floor. I explained that this was soon going to be his family if he didn\u2019t get his shit together he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s buying - he just hopes at this point it\u2019s what he asked for. \n\nHe just gave me a blank stare while I told him his. He didn\u2019t answer me in anyway he just stared. I ended it with, I can\u2019t make you do anything. You have to want it. Here\u2019s your appointment card for next week, I hope to see you here. I walked him out. \n\nI wasn\u2019t optimistic. By his answers I knew he was going to go right back to using. I was surprised today to get a phone call from my client. He called to tell me I thought about what you said and you\u2019re right. He had made arraignments to go to a halfway house tonight. He thanked me for everything that I said and it made him realize a lot. \n\nI wished him good luck and I broke down just a little bit. In some ways, maybe this was all part of the bigger plan.

Addiction isn\u2019t easy for the person using and even more so for their family members. You should seek some help from therapy groups for family members of addicts. They\u2019re in nearly every town - a quick google search will direct you where to go in your neighborhood. Don\u2019t let your ego get in the way of getting help - It\u2019ll help you a lot to be able to deal with the difficulties of having an addict as a close family/friend.\n\nSecondly, your right. Your brother will die if he continues down this path. I\u2019m sorry to be so blunt. He needs help. With this disease, outpatient and inpatient programs will be most effective if he himself is willing and ready to get help. However, even if he isn\u2019t ready - the support and tools they give him will plant a seed so that when he does finally admit to his problem, he can get help.\n\nGet him a list of Alcoholic Anonymous, opiates Anonymous, or narcotics anonymous meetings in the area. Literally print out or txt him or whatever a copy so he has it somewhere, so that when he\u2019s ready to admit to his problem, he can go. Also- get him an AA big book. Reading the stories of other addicts might help him relate. The back of this book is full of stories of addicts. Relating to these people and seeing how they got sober might inspire your brother.\n\nLastly, here are some professional tips:\nhttp://www.hazeldenbettyford.org/articles/what-can-i-say-to-get-you-to-stop\n\nFeel free to private message me too - I can  guide you from my experiences.

Kratom has some stimulant activity, but it\u2019s not very strong compared to even coffee. Not sure it really makes a difference in your responses, but the ephedra is in the form of 25 mg yellow bullet capsules.\n\nI\u2019ve been combining ephedra in the form of 25-50 mg of ephedra combined with 12-14 g of kratom to create a stronger kratom related euphoria. Usually one dose of 50 mg a day and 2 doses of 25 mg a day. I\u2019ve been using kratom for 5 years at 45 g a day for last 6 months. I\u2019ve been using ephedra for 75-100 mg a day for last 3 weeks, combined with the kratom and a big mug of coffee. Coffee is always necessary when taking kratom for a decent reaction; otherwise, kratom use does little due to tolerance levels (been using the store low quality stuff during this time). Combining coffee with ephedra is probably not advised, but no real problems yet, except for a few side effects described below. \n\nI have read online be the dangers of ephedra withdrawal, but am wondering if this has been enough time to become physically dependent on it and is it potentially dangerous to quit at home. I\u2019ve withdrawn from kratom enough times to know it is not so dangerous to quit at home, just hard psychologically and physically. \n\nCan anyone give me their thoughts on ephedra quit? I\u2019ve noticed that sometimes during ephedra doses, I get a sharp headache on right side, just for a few moments. I\u2019ve also been getting quite sleepy on some days in the afternoon between lunch and dinner doses. Paranoia and anxiety has been increasing, but I don\u2019t know if this can be attributed to ephedra because kratom abuse eventually leads to the same issues. I\u2019ve been able to sleep ok by taking some sleep aids and clonidine before bed.\n\nI want to stop using it *immediately* if it is not going to be life threatening.

He came into my room one night and offered me pot. Didn't want to sell it, just wanted company. So I got high with him.\n\nFor a long time it was just pot. Smoking with friends at school, smoking with my cousin and all his old, creepy friends who didn't mind bringing in a freshman in high school to smoke and drink with them even though some of them had kids.\n\nEventually it moved to smoking alone. Desperately. I'd spend tons of money on it. I would steal my aunt's pain pills because it helped get me higher than pot could. I would steal my moms liquor and get wasted. I would go to friends houses and drink way more than I should have.\n\nI bounced between this and being perfectly happily sober. No issues stopping any time I felt like it and sometimes, I just felt like it, so I stopped.\n\nOne day during a rough patch in my relationship and life my boyfriend told me I don't make him happy anymore and we should take a break. So I decided fuck it. I bought coke and ecstasy. Blew several hundred dollars on it, most my savings really, and after I finished I said \"K cool\" and stopped, but saved the dealers number. Worst part was he messaged me an hour later saying it was a mistake and he's sorry and he didn't want us to break up, but I'd already bought everything and just didn't care to stop.\n\nWhen I turned 21 and could buy alcohol legally the rough spot was still going on so I drank every day. Every 2-3 days I was buying more alcohol. I'd drink during the day, drink even more at night. Did that until I couldn't even stomach the smell of alcohol so I stopped.\n\nWhen I couldn't stomach alcohol anymore I dove back into coke. Hard. I was always a few hundred dollars in the red from overdrawing my account to buy more, I sold a few games and consoles I had, and I even considered stealing from my own family to fund it but I couldn't bring myself to do it.\n\nWhen I came clean to my family about the coke and stopped that, I was sober for a bit before jumping into pot again. I was worse than I ever was. I never stopped smoking, I would spend hours hiding away from my friends and family to keep getting high, I spent way too much money on it, and I acted like it was nothing. Like I was doing it to help a physical problem I have. But I wasn't.\n\nFinally one night I got high and I cried. I was sick of being that way. I wanted to go back to the me I was when I was sober.

I had mental health issues during the same period, mostly depression but a psychiatrist somewhat reluctantly diagnosed bipolar when I pressed him to come up with something.  The psychiatrists for whatever reason didn't consider my heavy drinking but instead prescribed meds which had no effect other than sedation for me.  Eventually I decided the alcohol needs to be addressed and I checked myself into a treatment program, quit drinking (and all drugs).  My mental health felt immediately better after quitting alcohol (within 2 weeks) so much so that I decided to try stopping the meds (antidepressent, olanzapine, and a benzo) too.  The sedation went away, my mood remained positive and moderate, and overall I just feel really good for the last year.  I've had no temptation to drink anything and am happy to never drink again.\n\nAnyway, I was offered a new job and it requires an extensive medical check which includes some focus on mental health and addictions.  The check includes some sections specifically asking about attending any treatment program and visiting a psychiatrist for any reason and the details around these encounters.\n\nI can't get around putting the details down as my GP must sign off on the accuracy of the report and he is aware of my history and all the records are electronic anyway.  But I'm looking for ways to mitigate what on paper might look concerning.  Specifically I am considering writing a letter in addition to the requested paperwork to explain to the effect that my mental health issues were substance related, I voluntarily sought help for both mental health issues and alcohol, and that I've as a result stopped substances altogether including no meds and have had very positive mental health for almost a year.  \n\nSo I'm wondering if providing an extra explanation is a good idea or if it just draws extra unnecessary attention to the fact?  I'm also wondering if this sort of evaluation has strict guidelines-based rules (ie. recovery for 1 year is OK, less than 1 year not OK) or whether these types of checks include judgement and opinions of the involved doctors? \n\nThe medical exam will be conducted and verified by my local family GP, who is also asked to give a determination whether I am fit for the described position.

When it comes to trauma though I generally agree with him. \n\nHis idea is that the best way to overcome your own trauma and evil done to you, is to accept your own capacity  for evil.  His reasoning is when the awful things happen to us, especially as kids, we spend a long time thinking \u201chow could some one be so evil, how could this have happened.\u201d The solution is to understand that we all have the ability to inflict  horrendously evil things on our fellow man, but it comes down to a choice to not do those things.\n\nThe thought experiment he uses is \u201ccould you be a Auswitz guard.\u201d Most people would probably say no to this. Mr. Peterson\u2019s point though is that maybe if you were born in German at a specific age, in a specific region, to a family with a specific world view, possibly forced to do so and with many other factors in play, you might  could be an Auswitz guard. \n\nWith all this said, I feel like this is what makes 12 step programs useful in their own way. Part of their purpose is to lead the addict through a process of accepting the flawed and fucked up parts of them selves and letting go of those things. Whether it is finding a way to let go of those resentments, or allowing your self to forgive your self for all the bullshit you have done along the way. \n\nLastly, a few years before I got sober I got really in to Joesph Campbell and Jungian archetypes. One of the archetypes is the shadow, people talk about this a lot, and you can find tons of stuff on YouTube and the internet about it. What the shadow archetype is is the dark part of self, that manifests as a monster (Mr Hyde, Dart Vader ect) When it takes control its impossible to stop and unleashed destruction on the world. In mythology the only way to defeat it though, is for the person to accept the Shadow as part of them selves, and to work towards controlling it. Which takes a life time of practice. \n\nHope that helps some. \n\nTL;DR you have to accept you own capacity to be evil and fucked up, then actively choose to not be evil.

(My suggestion would be to stop, limiting is NOT easy haha)"}]}]}]}], "t3_7z9v5r": [{"0_title": "i\u2019ve been clean off and on for a year, but i\u2019m having a hard time lately", "1_text": "i don\u2019t know where else to talk about this, my only friend is probably getting fed up with my self destructive behavior. \nas i said in the title, i\u2019ve been clean off and on for almost a year, it was mostly alcohol where i was drinking to a point of blackout every other day, then i started to do inhalants and i couldnt function without them, but my i started to take whatever people offered me without even knowing what it was. the past few months i\u2019ve been struggling with staying sober, i just miss the feeling of avoiding my issues, not being able to focus on the shit happening all i focused on was what my next drink would be.\ndoes anybody else struggle with these feelings? i don\u2019t have much of a support system and the people who say they support me tend to just call me an idiot or make my past addictions the butt of the joke.", "2_timestamp": "2018-02-22 00:49:14", "3_author": "yaboyassman", "comments": [{"Beesenhoney": [{"dunez8b": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-02-22 07:36:43", "1_text": "my friend your suffering from a disease, and its hard to over come it ,with the thinking that brought you there,, get to a 12 step meeting, give it a chance NA,,AA,, there will be a meeting near you, reachout and get a little support, you will be in a group of people who not only felt has you but found a solution to it, "}], "dup2wwv": [{"0_timestamp": "2018-02-23 01:09:48", "1_text": "Stop thinking so much and get to a meeting ur not unique.just frightend.

I hope you will focus on how hard you are struggling to help yourself.in some way.  Addiction is a bitch and it didn't happen for no reason.  You have a lot to be proud of even if you don't see it.  Many do not survive the things you have been through, and you are worth believing in yourself.  If you do nothing else, focus on eating and sleeping as well as you can, and see if you can find someone to talk to who can help you find some anchors right now.
