I have largely been quietly supporting my girlfriend on the sidelines, never saying anything directly to the parents. However, there is clearly a pattern of displacement, denial, and enablement on the part of the parents.\n\nRecently, we were at dinner, and the parents were discussing their 30 year old son's recent relapse in which he showed up at his ex girlfriend's job threatening her, and at his apartment building's office doing the same. However, they were excluding and reframing certain information from the past. In particular, they mentioned they never buy him anything and he has been supporting himself. I pointed out they actually bought him a car and $2,000 worth of furniture, and mentioned it's important to set boundaries with someone struggling with addiction.\n\nThey promptly lost their shit and became extremely agitated and it became quite ugly. The next day, they told my girlfriend they were primarily angry at me for giving them \"parenting advice\".\n\nPlease feel free to share your thoughts. I am looking for honest input to help understand whether or not I was wrong for speaking out, and whether or not it really constitutes parenting advice, given the circumstances.

As I mentioned, this has been going on for 5 years and the brother actually almost died last year of an overdose. My girlfriend has a bit of an introverted personality and struggles with asserting herself - as such, when she does try to point out these same basic realities, she is promptly shut down by her parents. They will either just deny what she is saying is true, (such as buying a car is enablement or that they bought the car at all, get bogged down in what the definition of the word 'listen' is), or just label what she is saying as negativity and engage in diminishing her general worldview and attribute her \"negativity\" to her worldview. \n\nSO when she DOES speak out, her thoughts barely get through the web of defense mechanisms, and the debate about her brother's addiction will often be reversed into an indictment of her thoughts and attitudes towards life.\n\nThis time around, I just couldn't take it anymore and was essentially just backing up my girlfriend. She thanked me afterward for helping her have a voice, but in doing so I guess I drew a huge line in the sand and have positioned myself as a threat to their attempts to make my girlfriend complicit in the enablement of the brother (if that makes sense)."}], "Evilevilcow": [{"0_Comment ID": "duwvp9v", "1_Text": "You're not wrong.

I\u2019m always fucking broke, always manic and wired, entirely unfocused, chronically underslept and nothing short of a slave to any sudden physiological impulse that strikes me.

You have to succeed yourself mentaly and you have to have a strategy with a goal to walk that road. Not saying that the physical part is'nt hard, it is.

It feels good, but I still have a long road to recovery before me. I'm not out of the woods just yet.\n\nMy experience was not typical, however, and I honestly wouldn't recommend doing what I did to anybody, not even my worst enemies (if I had enemies that is).\n\nSee, I decided to go in for inpatient detox and treatment instead of doing a slow taper. About a week ago I made this decision when I decided to finally kick my benzo habit to the curb once and for all. I was tired of benzos dragging me down and I honestly couldn't handle a slow taper. I figured I would just end up using again as I had in the past (been an off and on benzo/sleeping pill user since I was 18 and I'm 24 now). I just wanted this ride to be over with so that I could get off of it.\n\nA week ago I was a completely different person. A week ago I was on the verge of suicide. I was so close to the edge in fact that my psychologist said it would be best if after my appointment I made my to the ER for inpatient psychiatric treatment. I just wanted off the ride so, so badly that I was prepared to take my own life to do so. So, after that appointment I had my considerably emotional mother drive me to the ER and get me checked in. A short time later I was sitting on the bed of an ER room in a gown waiting to hear back on whether they had an available bed in their psychiatric unit or not. It was then when the gravity of the whole situation was really beginning to set in. Here I was in an ER room in the middle of Central Washington waiting, hoping that they had an open bed for me. Here I was a deeply suicidal, benzo addicted individual hoping I could myself on the right track once again, once and for all. There was no turning back now, this was my only chance and I was taking it.\n\nAround 9:00pm on that first night a nurse finally came in saying they had a bed ready for me. Shortly thereafter I was wheeled away to where the rest of my journey to sobriety begins.\n\nThat first night was hell. I was only about 12 hours into withdrawal and it was already kicking my ass. Not to mention, but that first night is always one of the worst with a flurry of doctors, nurses, and medical technicians constantly by your bedside checking vitals, drawing blood, and starting IVs. I don't think I slept at all that first night with how many times I was awoken by nurses and other staff in combination with how badly I was withdrawing from benzos. But, if it was any indication of what was to come I would have gladly taken everything back that had gone on that day to simply be able to withdraw at a slower pace.\n\nThe next day was an absolutely terrifying and unrelenting nightmare, a day that I wish to never relive again. By now the withdrawals were hitting me hard. Combined with the no sleep I had the night before the symptoms of withdrawal had me looking like an absolute train wreck. I was visibly shaking, my head was cocked to one side, I was sweating bullets, I could barely breathe, my heart was pounding, and my anxiety was through the roof and beyond what I had experienced in the past. If I were to put it on a scale from 0-10, 0 being no anxiety and 10 being the worst anxiety I had ever experienced, this was easily and 11. I had never felt so anxious in my life. It legitimately felt like I was dying, and to be quite frank I likely was quite close to dying. Anyways, after talking with a psychiatrist they finally put me on a medically controlled taper. That first day it took 4mg of lorazepam just to get my symptoms under control. Not even to the point where I was comfortable with them, just to the point that doctors weren't worried about my safety anymore.\n\nThe day after that was easier with my symptoms finally under control. That day I only needed 3mg of lorazepam to feel comfortable. However, I was still going through withdrawals, at least enough so that my dad noticed when he came to visit. To paraphrase him, normal users don't shake like we do when we stop taking our drugs (he is a recovering alcoholic/addict as well). The next day got even easier and I only needed 2mg of lorazepam to feel fine. The day after that (Sunday) I only needed 1mg of lorazepam. Finally, yesterday, I didn't need it at all!\n\nThat said, I'm still not out of the woods yet. I'm only through the most acute and life-threatening phase of withdrawal at this point. I still have a very long protracted withdrawal period to go through. Right now I'm battling the rebound insomnia and I don't foresee myself feeling normal for at least a few months. I mean, this was a nearly fatal and traumatic experience for me. It's hard to walk away from something so traumatic without a few lasting scars.\n\nNow, I will say these few words of caution before I finish this post. My case is fairly unique. For every case like mine there are likely 10 that didn't go as well. For one I was only coming off of a 6 month long clonazolam habit. Odds are that if I were coming off of anything longer that I would not have been successful. Second, I'm coming off of one specific benzo (though a highly potent one), odds are different benzos yield different results. Third, I'm still going through withdrawals and will be for some months. Lastly, I did the withdrawals in a medically controlled, safe environment.\n\nAnyways, I'm not out of the woods just yet. I still have a long, long road to recovery ahead of me. For now though I'll take things just one day at a time. Tomorrow things will be better.\n", "2_timestamp": "2018-02-28 09:15:42", "comments": [{"4research156": [{"0_Comment ID": "dv3wmkt", "1_Text": "Hey, man, I just wanted to say good job.

Would like some perspective.", "1_text": "Ok, here it goes \n\nWhen I was 15 years old I had a massive leg surgery. I was born with congenital hip dysplasia and had to have my femurs broken in half and reset using a titanium rod in each femur and screws at the hip and knee. Prior to this surgery I had little interaction with opiates. I was prescribed 3 (5mg) Oxycodone 4 times a day as needed. Along with Valium as well. \n\nIn that year I had the first surgery I also had four other surgeries. Taking out screws one at a time to eventually getting the rods taken out of my femurs. When they took the rods out the surgeon accidentally fractured my femur in the process. So for a full year I was on Oxycodone prescribed by the surgeon. \n\nAfter the accidental femur break after a year full of surgeries I had to go to my family physician to be put on a regular prescription once a month. The prescription I started at with the physician was 3 (5mg) oxycodone a day.  At this point I still couldn't walk by myself. I was on crutches and relearning to walk again. The pain meds were necessary. I was sent away from a surgery with a fractured femur and there's not much you can do with that other than not walking on it. \n\nThis is the most pain I have ever been in. Fast forward to now (I am 26 years old) I have had hip surgery and a lot of jaw surgeries because on top of the broken femur surgery I have Brittle Bone Disease (Osteogenesis Imperfecta) prior to the femur surgery I had broken 14 bones prior to turning 15 years old. \n\nMy last surgery I had was in July 2016. I tore my labrum in my hip and had to have that repaired. I still have a lot of pain associated with that and also have arthritis in my joints. My jaw joint is deformed and I do not have discs in there to separate the joint, so my jaw joints are bone on bone. \n\nMy prescription I am on now is 4 (10mg) Oxycodone a day and I can take about 8-10 of those a day and feel completely functional and pain free. However, I know I could feel pain free taking what is prescribed but mentally I just want more. I want that euphoria. Because since I was 15 years old that's all I have known. My mom is also an addict even though she won't admit it. She has taken pain meds her whole life and never discouraged me taking them at such a young age. So I thought that it was totally safe and normal to take them to function everyday. \n\nNot blaming my mom at all. She does her best. My brother passes away when I was 11 and he was 18. He overdosed on cocaine. He was addicted to opiates and had a night of partying and decided that he wanted to try cocaine for the first time and it killed him because of how many downers he had in his system (morphine sucker, Oxy, Hydros, weed) My brother went to rehab eventually and had gotten clean. But the night he died was the night he relapsed. So with everything my family has been through, I can't blame my parents for one thing other than I wish they didn't disappear for so long while I grew up.\n\nAbout 2 to 3 years ago I was finding myself buying oxycodone from friends at work and spending all of my money. (I'm married now so that had to change and I have stopped buying from friends). \n\nIt took a years lying to myself and denying I had a problem me but after finally admitting to myself that I was dependent on oxycodone I decided I want to quit cold turkey after the pharmacy wouldn't fill a prescription from my jaw surgeon and called my doctor and told him about it, I went to my doctor and wanted to quit cold turkey and just cried in his office. He handed me a suboxone card and I didn't want to do that, so I did cold turkey. it was hard, however, I got to day 2 and found out about Kratom. This saved me during this withdrawal period. But now, I am dependent on Kratom AND Oxycodone. I take both of those during the day. I can take up to 20grams of Kratom and 80mg of Oxycodone a day and be totally functional and work a full time job. \n\nI also take 2 soma and 2 Xanax and 1 ambien at night (not all at once, I space them out safely) I have restless leg syndrome and insomnia really bad ever since my femur surgery. \n\nAfter all of that back story (which isn't everything but I tried to condense) I finally broke down to my husband about my addiction and asked for his help. So our plan is to taper. I am taking a month off from work and I am going to be staying with my mother in law every day until my husband gets off work. They will be in charge of dispensing my medication and helping me taper everything. I eventually want to be off of EVERYTHING by the end of this. We will use the Xanax, ambien, and muscle relaxers to deal with the hard withdrawals and then we will tackle those later in the month. Here is my medication and doses I am on currently. \n\nOxycodone-10mg 4 times a day \nKratom- 20-35g a day 4-5 times a day \nSoma-350mg 2 times a day \nXanax-0.5mg 2 times a day \nAmbien-10mg once at night \nZoloft- 100mg once a day \n\nI want to be off of everything. I have been on the oxycodone and Xanax for 10 years (although I don't have any dependence on Xanax I just have bad anxiety and panic attacks but I am prescribed the Xanax with the soma. The soma I have been on for 4 years, the ambien for 8 years. The Zoloft for 6 years. The Kratom for 2.5 years. \n\nAny input on the tapering would be helpful. Thank you all for letting me share this story. I am a 26 year old who is 5 ft and weighs 90 pounds. I look like I'm 14. I am very active in voice over work and theatre. I live a good life other than this thing that has been hiding from everyone for 10 years now and I want to change that. I want to get to know myself again. I want to feel what I should feel again.

Life sucks being in pain, and life sucks on meds. At least, when you\u2019re off, though, the \u201csuck\u201d is stable, and not constantly peaking/dropping. \n\nI have chronic daily headaches and severe TMJ. I\u2019m in constant pain, and have been for 12 years. I started on Vicodin, getting it prescribed. They moved me to oxy\u2019s (15mg taken once daily). Every month, I\u2019d go to my doc and say it\u2019s not enough.. how I couldn\u2019t function, and was suicidal. He didn\u2019t budge tho. I did this for years, until I finally broke, and bought heroin. \n\nI never used needles, only smoked it. And it was easy to justify, as I was taking it medicinally, not recreationally. Like you though, I ended up blowing every cent I have, and ruining my life over it. \n\nEven though I was taking them for pain, not recreationally, I still decided to put myself into treatment. I went on methodone about a year ago (I wasn\u2019t healthy enough to do a full detox at the time). \n\nEven though I\u2019m not a traditional addict, I still benefitted a great deal from going into treatment. The accountability (UA\u2019s) helped me, and the reward system (if you do well, you come in less) helped as well. Also, I went to like 3-4 groups a week when I first started (wasn\u2019t working as much) and they helped SO much. I always walked out feeling totally cleansed, like I just came out of church or something. It gave me a place to talk about my suffering, where people really cared and wanted to help. I also got to help others, which was so great for me, emotionally. \n\nSo yeah, couple factors here at play. The groups are very important. Having someone to hold you accountable, so you\u2019re not cheating, is also very important (where you can\u2019t lie your way out of it). Having rewards in place, for doing well, is also a great idea. \n\nIf I were you, I would taper, and then go on suboxone. It\u2019s important you\u2019re not doing this yourself... outpatient rehab at a minimum. And everyone always bashes rehab, but me personally, I loved it. I made so many great friends, and had SO many awesome people that supported me. I also learned a lot. \n\nThe benzos can be super dangerous... definitely talk to your doctor about that. Also, I would NOT recommend getting off benzos, AND opiates at the same time. I\u2019d quit the opiates first. \n\nWhen you quit, make sure you have someone to take care of you, who can check in on you frequently. I don\u2019t know how far down you can taper, and how bad the w/d\u2019s would be with ample suboxone, but you\u2019re gonna want to be treated like you had the flu. Soup/ritz crackers. Someone to change the sheets if you get too sweaty. Massages help. Someone to make electrolyte water etc... also, sleeping pills are a must. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot more here to say, but I don\u2019t want to give too much info. I\u2019m about the same age as you, and I also have really bad chronic pain, so if you want to talk more, please feel free to message me. I\u2019d even welcome a phone call as well.

I tried a self taper, and it was hell.  By day 3 I felt inhuman.  Off to the doctor, the hardest part was admitting that I needed help.  Once that was done, the suboxone started, and I was dubious.  I've read that people get hooked on suboxone rather than what they were taking, and never make it off of that.  I also heard that people said it was harder to quit suboxone than it was to quit what got them there in the first place.\n\nABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE, at least not for me.\n\nThe doctor started what I thought was a REALLY strong dose of Suboxone ... I think it was stronger than what I was taking, honestly, I was so high it was making me nervous, but I found out that they need to fill up all of your Opiod receptors at first since Suboxone is only a partial opiod agaonist.  From here, they stabilize your dosage over a few days and then taper gradually.\n\nI went from 8mg to 4 mg to 2 mg to .5 mg over about 6 months.  Each time things were tapered I was nervous that I'd have jitters, DT's or cravings but other than a caffeine like anxiety and maybe a headache or two in the mornings, I was normal at each taper.  The reason for this is the long acting nature of Suboxone / Bupenophrene.  \n\nThis worked so well and I was able to maintain a normal work and social life without being sweaty, jittery, or anything.  If you are having a hard time I recommend doing this with your doctor.  Stay on regimen!  Don't deviate, don't slip up, and do not take more than you are prescribed, Suboxone is much stronger than oxycodone, and taking more than you should will only lengthen your taper.  \n\nIf you take longer than some people, the doctor should also stretch your taper treatment out as well.  \n\nLet me know if you have any questions, I'd be happy to help."}], "savagehenrysLSD": [{"0_Comment ID": "dv2axnr", "1_Text": "I broke my back when I was 18.

After eating late in the evening, I proceeded to drive out to the nearest gas station. I bought a jug of chocolate milk and a bag of powdered donuts. I proceeded to inhale the whole thing. It was an odd experience; i\u2014more or less\u2014blacked out during it.\n\nSince this time, I have not been able to stop binging. I have never really had a problem with food or weight, but this episode just set something off in my brain. \n\nFor the past month, virtually every night, I have gone out of my way to binge on food\u2014specifically palatable foods high in carbohydrates and sugars. \n\nI have wasted so much time and money, within the past month, on this \u201cfood addiction.\u201d It is exhausting; I can\u2019t seem to stop. \n\nMy sensual desire for food is isolating me from my family and those around me. I am currently a university student. As a result of this passion/obsession/addiction, I have been unable to focus on anything. I have a good GPA; I fear that my grades will suffer. \n\nMy love and empathy for others has withered during this time. It is so bizarre. My thoughts are constantly about food. My life is searing out of control.\n\nI am destroying my body and my soul. I am absolutely addicted to this garbage; I don\u2019t know how to stop. \n\nThere is no reason for me to be doing all of this. Nothing traumatic has taken place, as of late. This has happened as a result of my stupid decisions. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but my own. \n \nForgive me my fellow redditors.

The one good thing about addiction, is that it doesn\u2019t discriminate. Rich poor man women black white or any color in-between. It just gets people who are trying to escape. This is most likely a symptom of a much larger problem. Food has become a maladaptive coping mechanism for you. You might be dealing with anxiety or depression etc and to deal with Those distressing ideas you have developed  an obsession with food that plagues you with persistent and intrusive thoughts about it. These obsessions escalate to compulsions in which to relieve your negative mood you binge. It provides immediate relief and this isn\u2019t just mental, your body will react in the same way. So your brain has learned that feeling bad=food=binge=temporary relief. So it\u2019s not crazy that this compulsion keeps occurring, your brain is actually being quite rational. But these are maladaptive coping mechanisms and will just compound your emotional state in the future- leading to more binging. It\u2019s kind of a self fulfilling prophecy. You have to give your brain a chance to see what happens if you don\u2019t binge. Do you die? Do you feel worse? Do you feel like better? Because right now all it knows is binging is the go to problem solver for stress etc. I can not recommend exercise enough for this. The studies of its effect on humans makes it out to be he closest thing to magic. It basically helps with everything. So next time you have the urge to binge, try taking a walk. Removing your self from the situation, get away from temptation. If your new to exercise, that\u2019s fine! I\u2019m not saying run a half marathon, but I bet thirty mins a day would make you feel a lot better. You also have to identify the feelings that drive you to binge, so seriously try and talk to a counselor!  Also medication could help you with impulse control and cut down on intrusive thoughts. This is a common problem and is by no means chronic! It\u2019s better to address it early than to let it escalate into further pathology.

If I had nothing I would grab a whip cream can or chug some cough syrup. This is all before I met him in 2015, the year I got clean, aside from some alcohol and very occasional blunt.\n\nI've been \"clean\" by my terms since 2015 until this last October. I was living alone for a short time. It was a very stressful time due to some major life changes. That's when things went downhill. I became a different person. Irritable, angry, narcissistic even. I started drinking heavily and eventually found some meth from a friend. Never done it before. I was hesitant but I needed something like I needed air. Big mistake but I haven't done it since, thankfully I'm not around it. Soon after I felt so empty and even suicidal(thoughts, no plan to actually do it). Made up for the emptiness with drinking until I got hold of myself again and slowed down.\n\nI realize I go in cycles, while I'm thinking clearly now, next month could be different and I can no longer trust myself.\n\nI finally told my husband this past week about my childhood sexual abuse. Our talk went so well, I felt closer to him and it broke down some major walls.\n\nSo tonight I told him about the meth incident. My goal was that I would have someone I can trust to go to who can love and support me and know what's happening. Keep me safe from myself.\n\nAlthough he said he would be there for me, he wasn't happy(to be expected).. But he said he needed to protect his credit and assets that he had worked for.. like I am a threat to our finances. I got defensive immediately. I felt offended, attacked and vulnerable. I told him this and he got angry at me for not understanding his feelings too. I know he doesn't mean to make me feel this way. He is also afraid and takes the most logical route he can think of. But it felt so demeaning. I'm not really sure how to handle it. I want to keep open communication but now I'm afraid he won't understand and I'll feel worthless and build up more walls again. Maybe this is just something I have to accept and deal with but I don't know how to feel.\n\nUltimately we ended the subject and agreed to talk about it again later. I really need someone's insight.. I don't think he's in the wrong for feeling this way but it feels too far and I feel really disheartened.\n\nI do want to add he's always been loving, caring and supportive of me no matter what and I feel lucky to be with him.\n\nEdit: I should also mention I asked him for help as well to get into therapy.

I\u2019ve been going to the gym, taking online courses and generally trying to take better care of myself.

At my worst, that focus easily transforms into fixation, into addiction. \n\nThe thing is though, there is no set substance I'm addicted to. I will do anything I can get my hands on. I have preferences but mostly it's just anything that will get me fucked up.\n\nI have 2 close friends who know this about me and many acquaintances who could take a guess if they weren't fucked up themselves, but they can disregard it as long as I'm fun. Maybe it's relevant, maybe not, but I'm an 18 year old girl who's pretty tiny (5'2, 115 lbs) so it doesn't take much to get me trashed. It makes it easier for me to mooch off others.\n\nI have a few mental illnesses: chronic depression, anxiety, suicidal tendencies, dissociative disorder. I won't go into all of that because, honestly, we'd be here all night if I tried to explain lol.\n\nI'll tell you two significant stories involving two of my dearest friends which might give you a better insight on me. \n\nOne friend - who comes from a family of abuse and addiction, who also has a deeply self destructive personality (like me!) - is better at understanding why I do what I do. She knows everything about me. My trauma, scars, history. We have a confessional type of relationship. We both need constant forgiveness. She's the one I tell when I'm about to be on something.\n\nHere is one example:\n\nA while ago, a family member was proscribed Vicodin. From the moment I heard the word, the only thing on my mind was the Vicodin in the cabinets. So I told my friend that I was going to try it because my want outweighed the guilt and shame of stealing. You should have heard the way I tiptoed and maneuvered my way into discussing whether or not they were going to throw them away without outright asking if I could have them. It was repulsive. When they told me they didn't need them, I said that I would throw them away aka make sure they found their way into the safety of my hands. When I told my friend what I was doing, she told me not to so I managed to stay away for two days, but that resolve didn't last too long. To make them last, I would take a hardly noticeable amount for a hardly noticeable high. But it was still something. I upped the dosage so they ran out rather quickly.\n\nMy other friend is amazing. Instead of having a confessional-like relationship, we have fun together and can have fun without getting high or drunk. But we do it anyway. Despite me having hypocritically high standards for the people I allow myself to interact with, she hangs with horrible people and I'm always with her so I'm with them too. \n\nAnother example.\n\nI was with her and all these people I didn't like and we went for a drive. They pulled out these things that ARENT a drug but they give you a speedy rush of... something. Like a sharper than weed - but no longer than 30 seconds - high. I'm not sure how to explain it. My friend wouldn't do them even while I did. Later she would tell me that she was angry at me for doing them just to annoy her and honestly... I hadn't even considered her. I forgot she was there.They talked about doing something I was unfamiliar with and then all I could think about was how badly I wanted to use whatever that was all for that speedy high. \n\nThere are so many more examples of me disregarding people's feelings to get what I want. I'm barely attracted to men and have an aversion for skin to skin contact with them, but if I'm at a party and some guy has something I want, in the name of getting high, I will stroke their egos and flirt and charm to get it.\n\nDespite all of this, I'm not sure if it's true addiction. I can go without it as long as it's not within my reach. I can focus on other things. But if I can buy it or take it without anyone judging me or my parents finding out, it's mine. \n\nI'm not sure what to do because I know I can't control myself when I'm around it but it hasn't ruined my life or done irreversible damage to me to the point where I absolutely need to tell someone, right? I know I'm horrible and crude and any thing else that might have come to mind while you read this. I'm just a little lost and hope someone can understand.

They will still have the same hijacked dopamine and neurotransmitter systems.\n\nThere is a lot that goes into getting out of addiction and the mental aspect is just one part of it. There has to be basically a whole lifestyle and environment change to take place for the majority of people. For some people psychedelics launch that individual on the right path, for others it takes them down a very dissociative road where they become disconnected from themselves and reality. Do some more research on prolonged DMT use and look for the bad experiences."}], "mrtrav50": [{"0_Comment ID": "dv6nk8g", "1_Text": "Strike when the coals are hot..

(Warning, long and might trigger, but I'm desperate for someone to talk to me)", "1_text": "Throwaway here. I've been struggling with life and addiction for 15 going on 16 years now. I can't pinpoint where it started, where it went wrong, but I can't fucking control myself. I started with booze and weed at first, when I was around 15, and it was just the thing to do in high school. I got into the wrong crowd right off the bat. I was homeschooled up until 7th grade, where I went into a private school, the class size was about 20-25. I was extremely sheltered and socially awkward. I just wanted to fit in, I didn't like myself, I thought I was ugly and pretty dumb. So when I got into high school and was offered weed, I didn't think twice. It's just been a half of my life long shit show since then, and I'm near 31 now. My best friend overdosed about 6 years ago. He and I were doing Ritalin and Suboxone around that time, as well as drinking and methadone. I didn't fuck around with methadone just because it made me sick. He took too much one night, not on purpose (at least that's what I like to think), and didn't wake up the next day. I ended up quitting my job and moving back in with my parents. It took me six years to quit opiates after he died. I still drank and smoked, thinking it was the lesser evil. I secluded myself from everyone and everything, except when I had the opportunity to drink heavily with friends. I would usually drink extremely heavily by myself at home, I tried getting a couple of jobs but couldn't find any sort of drive, and just kept losing them. Last October, I drank and decided I wanted to go out to the bars because God knows why. I ended up getting a dui, and losing an opportunity at a job that I actually wanted to do for the first time in a very long time. I also stole tramadol from my sister who was letting me stay with her while I was looking for a job. I spent the next week in a crises center because I had no where else to go. I gave up, more than the other times. I didn't care if I lived or died, and actually just wanted to kill over. I got into a rehab center after that week, a 28 day program. I was off of everything, even the valium I was prescribed for my anxiety (which I would occasionally abuse). I finished the program, and got up to 4 months clean time. And then something just snapped. I don't know what. I went manic. I stole from my brother who also lives here with my parents, about 20-30, 20 mg adderall. I took them between 3-4 days. I lied when he caught me, but ended up telling him the truth the morning after. He had to get a safe box and a security camera to keep me out. I was okay for a couple of days, but the want for something to not feel like me wouldn't let go. Even knowing that he had that all because of me, I tried several times to break in. He is also an addict, and kept me out. But the craving wouldn't stop, and I was dishonest with my family and my meetings/counseling because I was so ashamed and I am on probation for my dui, so I was just being a fucking coward. Last night, I was going through my parents bathroom looking for anything, and stumbled across my father's hydro syrup for his cough, which he needs because of his heart condition and whatever else may be wrong, he doesn't tell me (and for good reason). I drank damn near the entire bottle, only leaving maybe on to two doses. I got fucking sick, but didn't feel guilt. I knew they were going to find out. I was just hoping it wasn't until my high went away. Just a few minutes ago my dad called me and said \"thanks for taking my medicine, that I needed while I go out of town tomorrow and I can literally  fucking die from my cough. But i hope it helped you.\" And hung up. I don't even know where my head is at. I am so fucking miserable every day. I don't bathe, barely eat, I can barely take a step out of my room to smoke a cigarette without rushing as fast as I can back inside because I feel so disgusting and ashamed of whatever I've become. There is nothing I can do to fix what I've just done. I'm packing my things and doing whatever I can to get into a halfway house, if possible. Even a homeless shelter if it is my only option. I was told I needed to move out of here while I was in rehab, but of course I manipulated my way into staying. During my 4 months, I really did want to stay clean and get better. It just got so fucked up so fast, I have 0 self control. I am terrified in my room right now, I don't know if my parents will kick me out now, call the police or my probation officer. I wouldn't blame them for whatever happens. I am so low. The only reason I don't off myself is because I don't want to put that burden on my parents. What should I do?

But he had to have known that it was not right since he had scripts from 5 different doctors!  We wanted him to go to rehab but he refused. His response, \"I'm not a druggie.\".  But unfortunately he is, just to legal substances. And I am furious at his main PCP. He wrote him a script for Vicodin for over a year. I had a talk with my father and told him this was wrong and he needed to stop taking them and pursue other pain management options. I think when the doctor finally stopped(without giving him other options!)..he went doctor shopping.  I am still struggling to understand addiction. I had major surgery a few years ago and was given a morphine drip. Out of a pain scale of 10, morphine only made my pain an 8. I actually had them remove it because it was ineffective for my pain and made me too itchy. For dental surgery I  received vicodin, out of 10 it did bring my pain to a manageable 3 but didn't make me this HUGE fan of opiates.

She ended up staying awake for days on end, and in her delirium she killed her roommate.  Scary stuff.  \n\nYea I like you're last line about making it real.  Admitting you have a problem is the first step.  And you sound like you have a serious problem.  I can relate.  Avoiding work, avoiding other people, avoiding your own reasonable reactions to the situation (ie stress and depression) by taking drugs.  I can relate to that borderline stimulant psychosis you've got going on, where you feel all sped up and involved in life when really there is nothing happening, and you don't produce anything worth anything.  Yea it's hard to come back down to a life that is somehow both mind numbingly boring and head splittingly difficult.  But you have to do it because that's where the real sustainable satisfaction is.  \n\nIt sounds to me like you sort of already know that...\n\nHere's my experience: I ended up dropping out of school and moving back in with my parents.  Luckily they were incredibly supportive, despite the fact that I was not in a place to appreciate their help, or even really relate to them at all...  I took a year off and went back two semesters later.  Not sure if that's an option for you, but if it is, please consider it.  Don't be afraid to look like a failure.  When you're better, you'll go back to school and crush it.\n\nI think the first part of rejoining society after a solitary stimulant binge is learning to relate to others as equals.  Because that's what they are.  They have strengths and weaknesses, confidence and anxiety, and all that good human stuff, just like you.  It really helps to handle these things cooperatively, to watch how others handle their life, copy their strategies and tweak them to your preferences, discuss your anxieties, give other people advice, blah blah blah.  Human life is ridiculously complicated.  It's not designed to be done alone.\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps.  I didn't really touch on how to get off modafinil, but I'd imagine tapering off is the best way to go.  But I dunno.  Cold turkey is hard because of the withdrawals, but tapering is hard because it gives you more time to change your mind...  All I can say for certain is that getting off that shit, no matter how you do it, is the second step, after admitting you have a problem.

And what do you do when you are feeling down about your problems? The same thing that's making you feel bad!  So it's a crazy spiral you get into to try and numb the shame.\n\nThis is why talking to a counselor is a great step, because not only does talking out your problem help you cope in a more productive, non-damaging, non-shaming way, but if the person is wise they can help you make changes that will actually improve your overall situation, which should help you get down less often.\n\nRecovery groups are great too because they help us connect with other people who understand us.

You may not have been physically addicted, but clearly you are using both cigarettes and food as a coping mechanism. As you say, without them you feel empty inside. Well, the truth is that you STILL feel empty inside even with them, because what can food or cigarettes really do to how you feel deep down inside yourself? They can only distract you from how you feel, which is what addictions are often all about: escaping and numbing pain of one sort or another.\n\nSo really, rather than looking for some substance or activity to help you avoid that feeling, you need to look at your life and your relationships and work on the reasons you feel empty in the first place.  I'd recommend getting a counselor if you can (don't know if you have health insurance but they are often covered) or even a recovery group.

You need to understand that you cannot in fact fix her. You both have a codependent relationship, understand that. It is also unwise to just be a \u201cgood friend\u201d to her considering your emotional relationship. You are going to have a very hard time just being her friend, I promise you that. I have been in a similar situation and what I\u2019m telling you is that you need to get out of this. You cannot save her and she will pull you down if you try. After a while you will come to resent her because the only person that can save her is herself. Again, the fact that you two have already been romantically involved means that the next step if you want to keep some of your sanity is to emotionally distance yourself from her. The reason why you latched on to what that other person said about just \u201cbeing a good friend\u201d is because subconsciously that\u2019s exactly what you wanted to hear, but what you don\u2019t understand is that it is the exact opposite of what you need right now. People aren\u2019t telling you these things to be mean. They are saying these things because when you are on the outside looking in, things are a lot clearer. You can\u2019t see yourself or her\nclearly right now, and that\u2019s the issue. We could miss a whole lot of the story but the fact of the matter is that she is an addict and you will always come second to her addiction. That\u2019s just how it goes. You need to save yourself. You can save no one but yourself, and as long as you remember that you will have better relationships. But the fact that you have this incredible pull to save her is less about her and more about you and the wounds that you have from childhood.  Something about her and her situation mirrors the kind of pain that you feel and the fact that you probably wanted somebody to save you, too. But I am telling you pal, this is not the road that you want to go down. Unfortunately, people telling you the same things over and over again is not going to cause you to change your mind because when you are in a romantic relationship with someone there are chemical changes that happened that cause you to be in it no matter what. Even when it is not in your best interest and in fact will take a toll on your mental health. You\u2019re probably going to choose to go through this and that\u2019s ok, but I just needed to repeat the same truth that others have said.

I'm sure there is something about her that is ineffably beautiful, and I'm positive that she is worth loving.\nHowever, your title says it: this is not a healthy love. This is a \"darker\" love, and the truth is, she is not in the right place to deal with the emotional turmoil of a new relationship.\nIt doesn't seem like you are trying to pursue a relationship though, which is admirable. You ask if you should \"stay the course, possibly aid her sobriety and help her flourish.\" There is a reasonable argument for both staying and leaving; unfortunately, you don't give us enough info for me to thoroughly argue my personal opinion, so I will give you both sides.\n\n1. You stay. That's a perfectly reasonable choice. However, in doing this, you will need to be COMPLETELY SELFLESS. As in, no expectations at all for what yoru relationship with her will be during or after recovery. Addiction is first and foremost a codependency issue. An addict will absolutely not truly recover if they jump from their drug of choice straight into the arms of some lover... and the scary thing is, she might try. You have to be strong and recognize that in her case, her need for someone is NOT love, even though it might seem like it. She might try to use you as an emotional regulator, thereby turning you into a replacement drug. There's a reason why rehabs don't allow people to enter relationships. In order to recover, she needs to learn how to manage her emotions herself and deal with the issues that might have driven her towards addiction. And, to be completely honest, I highly encourage you to do some searching within yourself as to why you're attracted to someone so clearly troubled. I'm not making any assumptions or trying to psychoanalyze, but the truth is *most* \"healthy\" people avoid entering a romantic relationship with someone like her. There is definitely a difference between an addict and a typical working adult, and that is a typical adult is self sufficient and will not require constant work around the clock. There is just no way your love interest will be able to contribute to a healthy balanced relationship that you deserve right now. Maybe she will a few years down the line, but you shouldn't take that chance. The person she is now will be VERY different than the person she becomes after recovery. That girl might not be interested in you at all, in fact, she might be angry at you or feel like you were trying to take advantage of her in her vulnerable state. The chances of things actually working out are maybe.... 20%. And within that 20%, there's a great chance of relapse or potential suicide attempts. Try reading \"A Million Little Pieces\" and its sequel, \"My Friend Leonard.\"\n\n2. You leave. You go on to pursue a girl who is much healthier and better for you, staying minimally if at all involved in the addict's life. Or...\n\n3. You stay and be her good friend. Trust me, THIS is what she needs right now, and something she will need for the rest of her life. If it helps, imagine that she is your sister, a girl you love unconditionally, and think of the advice you give her and services you render her as if they were for your sister. (these are just examples) Would you advise your sister to enter a relationship immediately after rehab? Would you advise her not to work and let a boyfriend support her? Or would you advise her to get therapy, and to call up a friend or family and vent when she is feeling bad? To keep a list of \"emergency numbers\" when she is tempted to relapse, etc. If you really love her, you have to love her as a person, with absolutely no expectations. DO NOT SLEEP WITH HER. Do not encourage her to sleep with others. \n\nAnd perhaps, perhaps, if you stay the course, and remain her very good friend for at least ten years (if she can stay sober for 10 years, she has a good chance of staying sober for good, IMO), then perhaps something beautiful can blossom..."}], "thebrightorangedawn": [{"0_Comment ID": "dvhz3yz", "1_Text": "Still living this situation and I am you in this story. If I could go back to the fateful day I decided to try to help and be there for \"A\", I would have made a VERY different choice than I did as I am still dealing with the aftermath. \n\nAddicts are addicts and always will be addicts no matter what.  \nIf she's been to treatment multiple times before, it is improbable that this time will be the cure all. \n\n\"A\" had already been through multiple psych hospitalizations and 2 rehabs when our paths intersected this time (we used to work together and kept in touch a few times a year for the past 5 years). He used everything from weed, to scripts, to mdma, to cocaine, and had been using meth for about 2 months at the time of this intersect. \n\nMeth stole my Mom from me emotionally, mentally, and then physically once she died. \"A\" has an 8 y/o daughter and helping him escape the same fate as my mom so she didn't end up like me (I've got serious abandonment, trust, love, and other issues),  became my goal without me even realizing it. Hindsight is 20/20.\n\nIn the beginning I tried to keep a distance and just be a friend, but like you I was drawn to him. With my encouragement and support, he started to get clean, he started working again, he was getting healthy again, and then we eventually started dating (BAD IDEA). He told me many of times that having me in his life took away the desire to stop using. The thing about addicts, they don't care about anybody or anything except their drug of choice and that's the truth. His using slowed down but it didn't stop like he had made it seem. When I found out, he said he would go back to treatment. \n\nI'll try to spare you the longer of the details, but that was 9 months ago. In the last 9 months he's been to rehab 5 more times and 3 psych stints. \n1st - he was there for a week of detox. Came out and relapsed 4 days later. 2nd - he was there for 30 days. I went to every family day, group therapy, I did everything the treatment center said that I could to do that could help and support him including going completely sober myself so that when he got out and came to live with me there would be zero triggers at home. He relapsed 85 days after getting out. After his relapse he 51/50'd himself and was stuck in a maximum psych facility for over a week. When he got out, he then went for a 30 day outpatient program at a different, lower level psych hospital. He relapsed 3 weeks after that program. \n\nOver the course of the last 9 months I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars trying to help him. On top of that, he has stolen over $3000+ from me with most of that happening with the very last relapse. I have not seen him since his last relapse in January but I have talked to him over the phone (explanation of why is below). \n\nHe has told me that when he left me after the last time he relapsed, he went back to treatment again, but he wasn't even there a full 24 hours. He had attempted suicide (and almost succeeded) and they put him on a 14 day 5150 hold in another (different) psych hospital. He called me from the psych hospital, but our conversations were not pleasant (due to the theft and abandonment) and I had decided to write him off for good. Unfortunately, that didn't last long as I shortly thereafter found out that I was pregnant so I got a hold of him to tell him (hence the phone calls).  He tells me he is now in another state in his 8th stint in rehab. He's going to attempt sober living after. I am keeping my distance at this point,  but due to my current circumstances, I am unable to completely cut him off.\n\nI tell you this story not to gain sympathy, but as a warning. I have been physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially drained because I was drawn to an addict who had already ruined all other relationships in his life because of his addiction. Because I felt bad for him, I have now put myself into a major life altering situation in which I am still trying to figure out. \n\nAddicts need professional help.

Yet there are people who can drink a beer or two and then go home or people who have tried cocaine and not liked it at all. So why didn\u2019t they become addicted and I did? After starting my recovery process I realized that drugs are just the tip of the iceberg. Drinking and using are barely the symptoms of what\u2019s really going on underneath it all.  For me addiction is as physical as it is mental and spiritual. It involves a desire to avoid reality as well as (or more so) a lack of emotional awareness and control. Ask any addict out there. Had a bad day? I need a drink. Got something to celebrate? Lets get a drink!. I\u2019ve come to realize that using and drinking had become an automatic response to any situation or stimulus around me. Addiction for me is a way of coping with what I wish not to deal with. For a time, alcohol and drugs were the solution. \n\n\n\u2022What was the moment that you realized you needed to get sober? \n\nWe always believe that we can control it or stop using anytime we decide to do so. I like asking the newcomers when faced with this belief \u201cThen why don\u2019t you stop using for a while and show yourself you can control it?\u201d More often than not they won\u2019t be able to stop thus breaking denial. I realized I had a problem the day I honestly wanted not to use but found out that I could not stop. I could not stop using even if I wanted or tried. It took me a while to realize I needed to get sober though. I realized I needed to get sober they day I woke up at a hospital missing my left arm. I realized I needed to get sober after I had first hand physical evidence of the uncontrollable damage I was causing myself and others. No one wishes to loose a limb but I did it to myself anyways. I realized that this \u201cthing\u201d was beyond my control. \n\n\n\u2022What helped you become grateful for your rock bottom? \n\nAn attitude of gratitude. I'm honestly certain that had I not lost an arm I would be using right now or worse, dead. There\u2019s no way around it. When I think about how my life was a year ago and compare it to where I\u2019m now it\u2019s impossible not to realize that things had to happen the way they did for me to get clean. So many people try and try again and again to get clean or sober without success yet here I am a year later clean and serene enjoying life as I never had before.  Why would I stop and question the events that got me clean? I\u2019m grateful I got out of drugs and alcohol and do not stop one second to regret the circumstances in which it happened. It was a fair price to pay for what I\u2019ve gotten in return. A high price, but a fair price none the less. \n\n\n\u2022What was your greatest challenge in early recovery? \n\nFear, probably. Of creating a new way of living. Facing myself, my past and my present. Having to change only one thing in my life: everything. What was I going to do now? How was I going to be able to enjoy life? With whom would I share and spend time? Would I be able te stay clean and sober? All this questions generate fear and anxiety. Then I remember that my most important goal every day is to not use. As long as I stay clean, one day at a time, I have a chance. Addicts are used to immediate satisfaction. We want it all and we want it now. So patience was and is the key for me. Things might not be going as  planned but I\u2019m convinced 100% that no matter the situation at hand, using will just make it worse.   \n\n\n\u2022Why would you recommend both NA and AA?\n\nAs I mentioned before, addiction is physical as well as mental and spiritual. So I would recommend any kind of \u2018A\u2019 for that matter. I recently heard this and I really liked it: \"An addict who isn\u2019t an alcoholic is just an alcoholic who never used alcohol because he had other drugs\u201d. When I understood that it had nothing to do with what substance I used, that the problem is and has always been me; it stopped mattering whether I identified myself as NA or AA. I go to NA meeting because they take place just around the corner from where I live and it\u2019s easier for me. And even though I read both NA and AA literature I choose the AA Big Book as the basic text for my recovery for ir carries the most pure and original message of recovery. NA and any other 12 step program come from that first \u202aAA 12\u202c step program anyways. I\u2019m open to all recovery as long as it adds to my personal and spiritual growth. Although \u201cI\u2019m not an alcoholic\u201d, I know that if i take up drinking it will eventually lead me to the same place from which I got out. The goal is to stay connected to myself and reality without the need of mind and body altering substances. \n\n\n\u2022How do you stay positive?\n\nAgain, with an attitude of gratitude. Remembering where I come from and where I\u2019m now. Knowing that using will only make things worse. Keeping close contact with addicts and alcoholics who\u2019ve found that new way of living. People that have what I want or at least want what I want. It\u2019s not the past that keeps me from using, it\u2019s the future that\u2019s waiting for me if I just stay clean one more day. \n\n\n\u2022What would you say to someone who is afraid to get sober?\n\nThere is a solution.

I will start making good money and start doing harder and harder drugs. Eventually it catches up with me (sleepless nights, depression) and I start to miss work. I usually quit the job out of shame but have gotten fired a couple times. Then I'll be broke, so forced to be semi-clean (only Weed and alcohol and not every day), then it repeats. \n\nI've tried psychiatric treatment, psychologists, and it never helps. I either end up abusing the meds, or they don't work, or I don't give them time to work. Honestly, I haven't given psych. Treatment my all since I'm convinced that my issue is substance abuse and all the psychological problems are stemming from that...but its kind of a chicken-or-egg thing...which came first the substance abuse or depression...\n\nNow I have a brand new, GREAT opportunity...once again. I have only been smoking weed and drinking on occasion for 3 months, after 2 months of COMPLETE sobriety. Until 2 weeks ago...I fucked up and snorted oxy...Then again the next day...and the next...1 week into it I already knew. I am going to have to experience opiate withdrawal again. But instead of stopping, I did it every day for another week and here I am. Wanting to quit, but now starting a new job tomorrow and I really don't want to go through this at work, at a new job. FUUUCK.... I stopped for over 48 hours (from Saturday till tonight) with minimal discomfort, but that is with weed. As soon as the cannabis effects start to wear off, I feel the stomach pains, get the shits, a little nauseous and very minimally irritable. I can't be high at work...\n\nAm i making too much of this and can i probably just stop cold turkey after 2 weeks? I am associating this with the time i REALLY felt the withdrawal after doing opiates every day for almost a year. That being the only experience I've had with being dope-sick, is the withdrawal after 2 weeks of use nothing compared to that?

I hope.. its a long story..\n\nUp front, this is a new account I just made for personal anonymity. My entire family uses reddit and knows my real account... Anyway, this is kind of a long story so I will try to cut it down.. I am a 25 year old male from California. My depression started early in life. Apparently, I wasn't going to make it as an child for a reasons nobody even told me about until I was about 21 (but thats a whole 'nother fucking can of worms.) Regardless, this condition had me put on steroids and hgh at a young age which jump started my puberty and make me massively obese. It ruined my entire childhood until around 13-14 years old when I was finally able to shed the weight. I thought this would make me happy, but it didn't. I decided I needed to switch from the private catholic school scene because I was just different, plus, not rich like everyone else. Well, in public school is where I really came into myself. I began making friends with all the wrong people. I got heavily into drugs to deal with my anxiety and depression. Of course, it was undiagnosed at this time. Flash forward to high school. I was a junkie the entire 4 years. I hid it pretty well until Junior year when I just couldn't anymore. I dropped out, finished high school at an adult school and wound up actually starting college early at around 17 (just because it was expected of me, I absolutely hate college..but well get there) I spent the next 5 fucking years at a community college because I was constantly skipping the two classes a week I would take just to go get high. I developed ulcerative collitis, so more often than not, I am in an immense amount of pain if I am sober, and I am in an immense amount of pain for smoking in the first place.\n\n5 years later I finished, after a slew of fucked up relationships, lost friends, deaths, hospital visits, and rehab stints, I finally finished. This did wonders for me. I decided I WANTED to get my shit together, I got clean. For 3 years I got clean. I did it all on my own..well, with a therapist and suboxone, but still. I got myself a job. I made friends at that job. I saved up money and bought myself things I never could before. I've always loved making music so I invested in my musical abilities and was generally just happy, for once in my life, I was content. Well. That didn't last long. At the end of the 3rd year my family decided it was time for me to go to a university. Shit, I even thought it might be. I was so damn confident of my recent sobriety and accomplishments that I felt as if I was finally ready to take on the world. Fuckin' long story short. I'm in my second semester of university. I am studying the major I am best at..and I thought I was interested in. English. I have been writing my entire life, it's the only way I can really express myself because I am the most reserved, anxious, quiet person you'll meet. Turns out I'm not interested in the academic version of it. By the end of my first semester I was picking up again. I was telling myself, I'll stop once it's the weekend, once I get through these mid-terms. Once it's break. Yadda Yadda. Once I have time again, I will get myself back together. This is just to deal, I would say. Well. As you can imagine, it wasn't, it's not. It's a fucking problem, yet again. I've literally kept using since last semester. I can sometimes go a few days during the weekend without it, thank god for suboxone. But..ANY school day. Actually, EVERY school day. I pick up on my way to class, or I don't go. It's basically that simple for me. If I'm not high, I'm not there.\n\nI've convinced myself that I can't deal with school without drugs. And, past experience tells me I can't. I hate it. I hate the system, I hate the people, I hate the shit they try to brain wash me into thinking and believing. I pretend for the sake of saving face, for the sake of everything just going smoothly, when deep inside, I completely disagree with everything. I completely have a different philosophy about life and happiness. I don't feel like this is for me, but it HAS to be, you see. It just HAS to be (FAMILY expectation), or else I have nothing to live for, nowhere to live, and nobody to help me. I type all this and still feel like I haven't adequately expressed what is happening.\n\nOver the course of these past few months. I've ditched class more than ever, my grades have taken a massive hit, my teachers suspect something is wrong with me, my parents accuse me every day, don't trust me again, and all I do is argue with them and demand they believe that I'm still sober. They tell me over and over if I go back to drugs, that's it. I'm out of the house, they're not helping me pay off my debt, I will have to drop out of school, etc.\n\nI stopped seeing my therapist, I quit my job, I withdrew from anyone that attempted to talk to me in the beginning of my semester and I pretty much just get high in the parking lot, nod off through class, go home, do the homework, get high and fall asleep. I've blown through all the fucking money I saved up over the years. I'm down to 100 this week and because I have a massive presentation tomorrow, I'm sure I will blow it today on my way to class.\n\nI'm disappointed to say the least. But, all I can think of is how much worse everything will be if I have to admit defeat, if I had to quit and start over, if I wasted all this time and money and effort. If my family dynamic goes back to how it was, when I was the me before.\n\nI feel like right now I'm a fucking timebomb that can go off in either direction. I don't know which direction is worse, honestly. Go deeper into depression and addiction but come out on the other end with that fucking piece of paper, woohoo. Or just drop it all and concentrate on being healthy and happy again? The problem is, future me will be so upset with me now if I give up. But future me will also have a lot more to deal with if I'm a full blown junkie again. It feels like I'm constantly living for someone else, even when it's all for my own benefit. It feels like my \"here and now\" is a fucking dream and the real me is in this intangible future. If I keep giving in now, I will regret it later, I know. But it's the only way I can get through now. What the fuck do I do?..\n\nI feel like even this is a waste of time. Too long, skips too many details, trivializes the whole thing. Fuck it.

And thank you for the recommendation, I\u2019m going to watch this now. I know exactly what you mean too. I\u2019ve realized you are right. The connections I made while sober with my co-workers, the purpose of having a job, the empowerment from having money..I believe all of that led to my happiness. And just as you surmised, I lost all of that because of school. It\u2019s true, I have no connections at school. I cut off all my ties with local friends because they are just completely strung out and I can\u2019t be around them. I feel completely alone because I can\u2019t talk to my family either about these things when I need someone to talk to. When I was just working on staying sober and keeping my job it was easy for me. I had no desire to use anymore. No cravings. Nothing. It all came back with a vengeance in school. I feel it might be related to my heavy use during high school and community college. Perhaps I subconsciously connect school with drugs..I don\u2019t know why I feel this way in school because I\u2019m not a bad student. I get good grades..even impress my teachers with my writing abilities. It\u2019s just all so empty to me. It doesn\u2019t carry any meaning. I desperately want to finish my schooling and get my degree because I know, in the end, it will make me feel great about myself. It\u2019s just the fear of the damage I will do again in the mean time. I\u2019m afraid that if I make the drastic decision to drop out and focus on myself and sobriety again that it will just compound my depression when I realize I gave up and made no progress again. It\u2019s a slippery slope because either way it\u2019s a bad decision, in my opinion..I\u2019m honestly not even sure what I\u2019m expecting to hear but hearing I\u2019m not alone makes a world of difference. I did manage to go to class today and stay sober. You\u2019re also right about being proud of the experience. I feel like the places my addiction took me to, the lows, the disparity, all for me to come out triumphant in the end made me a much better person. I saw myself become extremely compassionate and empathetic. I found happiness in helping others. It just wore off on me. And I made a huge mistake going back to drugs..but the fact that I can even see this and admit it gives me hope. I know I can find the strength to get myself out of this mess again. I just wish I could force myself to do it right now. But I do feel happy I made it through just one more day. At least I came out triumphant this one day again.

I looked at it as more of a way of heeling than anything else. Drugs felt really positive at first, they were fun and made the healing process a lot easier. I got to comfortable though and it turned into much more of a habit. First taking mushrooms then acid, ecstasy, dxm and adderall. I think I\u2019ve always been risky to an extent but I didn\u2019t have the same access I have now. I have a constant supply of adderall through my boyfriend and ecstasy/acid are very easy to get, I also don\u2019t have to pay for weed most of the time. \n\nI bought a 10 strip of something that was not acid (felt more like a psychedelic amphetamine if that makes sense) around September and decided to use it anyway knowing it was sketchy and by the beginning of November it was all gone (I sold about 3 tabs). This left me feeling depressed and even a little suicidal, I\u2019ve felt more outgoing and like I learned a bit about myself but overall it left me worse off then before. I do struggle with depression and I\u2019ve been stressed about graduating and the near future so this isn\u2019t completely new but I didn\u2019t feel suicidal or as mood-swingy before this mini acid binge. \n\nWhat I\u2019m struggling with more however is this constant cycle of weed and adderall abuse, I justify it in my head because it\u2019s hard to work and go to school but I know in reality it\u2019s having more of a negative impact then positive one. I do have ADHD but my mom took away my prescription after I abused it, my boyfriend knows I struggle in school though so he encourages me to take his pills. I no longer feel dependent on it because I\u2019m not taking it daily anymore but I do snort it often which I know isn\u2019t productive or healthy. \n\nI\u2019m leaving for Mexico in a week and I hope getting away from all the drugs helps me clear my head because right now the possibility of that is all that\u2019s keeping me from doing something really stupid.

Many other drugs came and went with addictive episodes- opiates, LSD, mushrooms, cocaine, exstacy.. but weed is the one that stayed with me.\n\nI never thought of it as a problem but now 7 years later I know how much it has held me back growing up. All the time wasted smoking and doing nothing as opposed to anything else.\n\nObbsessive gaming didn't help the laziness either, and it became too easy to just stay at home and live in my own world then deal with the one outside.  This bloomed into a hell of an anxiety problem and socially reclusive behavior. Again, other drugs contributed to this as well.\n\nNow, I see a nasty alcohol addiction just entering my life being 21.  I can't sleep, eat, have fun, or really even function without one or the other in my system.  I've been drinking close to every night for almost a year now, along with compulsively smoking even at inappropriate times like before work or small smoke breaks watching my nieces. \n\nI really want to break these habits for good as I need to have my motivation come back. I also hate when my 2 yo niece sees me stoned- commenting on the smell or the \"weird\" behavior... \nAnd for drinking, that is a much darker demon in my family as both sides of my parent's families have a long line of alcoholics. Several family members have died in my lifetime from drinking.. two commit suicide while belligerently drunk, another died of alcohol withdraw after a month long bender... \n\nI feel at this point I have exhausted the obvious resources. Went to drug therapy on and off for years with never any real success. Any meds they put me on made me insane so I quickly dismissed that as an option. \n\nIf anyone else out there has these things that most people don't consider to be really big issues knows that they aren't the best versions of themselves using these things even if it isn't necessarily shooting up or smoking meth or whatever.\nAny advice is appreciated.

I didn't expect the post to get any response at all so I didn't go into much detail; but I tried the quit instantly method. It works in the sense I can pull away from everything for maybe a month or two, but any addict would know that caving is very easy to do when you quit cold turkey because you can just tell yourself you can pull away from it if it \"gets bad.\" They it ramps up again and boom your back to where it began. The last stretch I tried cold turkey, I sought out medical help and the psychotropic drugs were too much, to say the least. They tried so many over the course of a year I'd say and I finally broke from that but instantly went back to using, which was my worst bender of using ecstacy 3-4 times a week, sometimes for days straight. I didn't include that one in my post because I recently broke that addiction. Once it is a clear issue and caused plenty of destruction, it's a lot easier move away from it.

We meet up at his, buy a few rocks, smoke, chill then I leave. He's pretty low-key lifestyle. He has a job but after that he doesn't do much and he lives alone. We have a couple of friends in common. Our smoking of crack is private to us and us alone. None of our friends know we do this. So there's no one I can turn to. \n\nHe smokes way more than me; he's told me of nights where he smoked almost 300 dollars worth with another friend of his. Now, when I smoke, It feels amazing and all, but after a couple of hours I never feel the need to smoke another, unless I want to. I just don't get addicted. So I assumed he doesn't either. I have asked him this as well and at the time he told me he had it under control.\n\nThis friend owes me money, I'm sure he owes other people money too. He cannot afford to be smoking crack left and right... He has rent, bills, food etc. to pay And I have told him, as long as you never borrow money to smoke, you're good. \n\nTonight he called me telling me there was a small sharp thing in his throat. That he couldn't breathe, that he feels like his throat is closing and he would not be able to breathe soon and was vomiting blood and would need to go to the hospital. He asked me for cash and I said I did not have any, but offered to come to his and drive him to the hospital. \n\nHe explains the full story: He smoked on sunday, and some of the metal 'filter' got into his throat. Since then he has vomited, pooped a little blood (red) and been spitting blood (red). Also, he still feels the prick of the metal in his throat. \n\nAt this point I am suspicious. I think he might be paranoid and he's okay, but I would rather not be proven wrong and risk his life. \n\nAfter waiting at the first hospital for close to 2 hours, we still hadn't gotten an x-ray or any closer to figuring what the hell is going on with him. Now I know he can get paranoid when he smokes, so I ask him if he had any tonight and he says he had not. \n\nWe leave the hospital and head to another hospital.\n\nI call the mutual friend and tell her what's up. Not the crack thing, but everything else. She tells me that when she was at his, she didn't see blood in his spit, but he claimed he did. This sheds more doubt on him, at this point I suspect he is just being paranoid. \n\n2 hours have passed and even though he told me his throat was closing, he's still here. Now he's restless, pacing up and down. I tell him to calm down and relax, so he could breathe easier.  The whole time, he intermittently goes out to make phone calls. Some, to borrow money, others to call his debtors, and some of his doctor friends. Although not to much luck, a lot of them are asleep or not picking their calls. \n\nI keep insisting an X-ray be done\n1. to clear my doubt\n2. to have a clear idea to what is wrong with him. \n\nI suspect maybe the metal filter left a small scar in his neck and that, coupled with the paranoia is making him overreact.\n\nThen one of his friends loans him some money...\n\n30 minutes go by and this is the first time he is considering that the filter in his neck might be an injury. \n\n20 mins go by and he asks me to take him home, that he would use his car to go to the national hospital. At this point I am exhausted and battling these thoughts in my head, but I take him home. \n\nWe just parted ways before I sat at my laptop to type this. \nI don't know what to do... I suspect he might be borrowing money to buy crack. Am I over reacting? How can I help him before he does something dangerous? Should I have left him to drive himself?\n\nI am so confused right now.. any advise or help would be appreciated.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the advice, he's feeling much better now. He was prescribed some medicine at the hospital and has resumed work.

I feel like a mess right now but I'm self-aware enough to know this isn't something I can fight alone anymore but I have no clue where I should even go or what to do to begin the process of actually getting the help I know I need. Plus I'm scared, so there's that. \n\nI guess I'll start this off by talking about myself and telling \"my story.\" Sorry for how long this will be, but I feel like I need to get this shit off my chest even if it's just to a bunch of internet strangers, because I've never shared my story like this and I think I need to.\n\n I'm a 21-year-old woman, and my addiction issues started when I was maybe like, 11 or 12? Since the moment I discovered drugs I used them to self-medicate, especially when I was a teenager. I honestly think I was born with depression and anxiety because I can't remember a time I didn't not struggle with them, even when I was a kid. So basically growing up I was an extremely anxious kid, I had severe social anxiety so I didn't have many friends, which obviously caused me to have low self-esteem and I had an extremely distorted perception of myself and my self-worth, which I think is what eventually triggered my depression into becoming as bad as it did. My first real addiction was self-harm. Cutting was honestly like a drug to me. I NEEDED to do it, I craved it, and immediately after self-harming everything would feel okay for a little bit. And then the cycle would repeat itself. \n\nSo as I said my first experience with addiction, in my opinion, was self-harming. However, my first \"big\" addiction and without a doubt the most difficult thing I've faced and am actively facing is my eating disorder. Idk if you can be born with an eating disorder or just be predisposed to having one, but I have very clear memories of having eating disordered thoughts and irrational guilt toward food as young as 7. So my eating disorder started how they typically start, when I was 11/12 I thought I was \"fat\" so to try and lose weight I started eating \"healthy\" and then eventually just started skipping meals altogether. It didn't become super serious though until I befriended a girl in high school who had bulimia, and I got the idea in my head that she was skinny and I could do what she was doing and that I could just \"stop\" doing it whenever I reached whatever goal I was trying to reach. Well I'm sure I don't have to tell you guys but I realized pretty quickly that I couldn't just stop whenever I wanted. Plus my own eating disorder fed off my bulimic friends eating disorder. For those of you that also have eating disorders, I'm sure you know that that they're competitive. I wanted to be not only skinnier than her but also sicker than her. I'm still not sure why, but that's just how it is when you're sick.\n\nAnyway so I ended up getting really, really sick. I'm not gonna get into war stories but I clearly looked sick (though I didn't really see how severe it was the way everyone around me did, because I had/have body dysmorphia, which is such a bitch) and everyone around me knew but they couldn't do anything since I didn't want to get better nor did I consider myself \"that\" sick. And while all this was going on, I actually, truly, didn't have any friends, because I was batshit crazy, my ED made me push everyone away so I could just quietly be sick and no one would bother me, I was borderline-emotionally abusive and manipulative to everyone that cared about me, and to top it off my social anxiety was severe to the point that I was terrified of leaving my house. \n\nSo I was in one of if not one of the lowest and loneliest points of my life. I don't really think I ever had any kind of specific rock bottom  moment that made me realize I wanted to get better, the closest thing I can think of is I remember one day sitting on the floor bawling because I just wanted to eat a slice of pizza but I genuinely could not do it because my eating disorder told me I wasn't allowed to. And I mean, it REALLY felt to me like there was another person that would tell me loud and clear in a voice that was not my own what I could and could not do and if I didn't listen there would be severe consequences. Like I was in an abusive relationship is a good way of describing it. So shortly after the experience crying over the pizza, I think this was September/October of 2012 (I was 17-going-on-18, and had been seriously sick since I was 14 at this point), I decided to try and recover all on my own. I was too afraid to admit myself to inpatient and I couldn't talk to my parents seriously about getting eating disorder treatment because they just didn't get it. So I made my own meal plan, genuinely tried to stop throwing up, and gained the weight I needed to gain to be \"healthy.\" And for about 3 years, it seemed like I had a pretty solid recovery.\n\nSo here's where I get to the part about me losing my way, as the title of this post suggests. I'm not really sure what happened, but last October I started throwing up again, a lot. I was probably stressed about something, that's usually what the problem is when I end up making myself sick. It's like an extremely unhealthy method of emotional regulation for me. But anyway, I just took it as a small slip-up, not a relapse, shit happens, for me it wasn't anything I couldn't handle. However, at this time I had also just started a new job as a bartender, which is where drugs really started to come into play. I think this is where the beginning of my relapse really started and I just didn't realize it, or ignored it, whichever. I was abusing the fuck out of adderall that I was getting through a connection at work and rationalizing it by telling myself it was to get through my 14-hour physically demanding bartending shifts. But I also reallyyyyyy liked not having an appetite as well, and I had stopped throwing up again! So I told myself I was fine.\n\nThis went on for about 5 months. Obviously I lost a lot of weight which had people concerned including my friend who was originally selling me the adderall so they stopped selling it to me. So once that connection was gone, I turned to a guy I knew who could get cocaine. And because I was making a shit ton of money bartending, I just replaced adderall with cocaine, which, as it turns out, was a much more slippery slope to addiction than I expected it to be. And it took me about 6 months and one pretty shitty comedown from a 24-hour cocaine binge to realize it, but I'm pretty sure I'm an addict.\n\n\nSo here's where my head is at currently, and the whole reason I decided to make this post. 5 months ago I moved out of my parents house and as a result started a new job, where I've met a lot of really great friends. A handful of them happen to be ex-addicts, and they were the first people to start calling me out on my addictions. I tried to argue with them that I had been in active recovery from, specifically, my eating disorder, but they weren't buying it, and that's what really got my thinking about my \"recovery\" and whether or not I'm still in recovery at all anymore, or if I've just been saying I am out loud because that's where I'm supposed to be, mentally speaking. So while my friends are what initially got me reconsidering all this, what really made me come to this realization is my dad. My dad's been an addict for 30 years, more than half his life, and for the first time in his life he's made the decision to enter recovery and get clean. I never in a million years thought he would ever decide to fight back against his addiction, especially after being in active addiction for 30 years and never once expressing any desire to get sober. I mean, that HAS to be a sign, right? \n\nI truly appreciate anyone who actually took the time to read this whole post. Again, sorry for the length, but I felt like sharing this could maybe be the first step to taking recovery seriously again. \n\n", "2_timestamp": "2018-03-21 07:32:04", "comments": [{"DrRecovery": [{"0_Comment ID": "dw1aoeu", "1_Text": "The best and most honest advice I can give you is to look for the nearest AA group and join other people just like you.
